	/* EDIT SHIP.CGI TO HAVE A WARNING SIGN WHEN FUEL COUNT IS LOW */
	/* 	IN TRADING.CGI, YOU SHOULD WARN PEOPLE THAT ALL ITEMS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE
		DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE OPTIONS PAGE WHERE YOU CAN DELETE YOUR GAME */

Though you can buy many ships, you can only use one of them at a time due to traffic overcrowding legislation

	 /* PERHAPS YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO BUY NEW SHIPS AND FUEL WITHOUT LEAVING YOUR PLANET
	 	(EITHER BY MAIL ORDER, OR VENDORS EXISTING ON ALL PLANETS),
	 	OTHERWISE YOU COULD BE STUCK SOMEWHERE. ACTUALLY, PERHAPS YOU COULD FILL UP YOUR SHIP'S 
	 	FUEL TANK ON SOMEONE ELSE'S PLANET TOO FOR THAT SAME REASON.
	 	IT SEEMS WE NEED TO SEPARATE THE IDEAS OF SHIP FUEL (STORED IN THE TANK)
	 	AND MACHINE FUEL (STORED IN THE CARGO HOLD) */
