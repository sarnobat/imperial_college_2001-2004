<h1>How to Play</h1>

<ol>
<h3>Joining the game</h3>
<li>If you haven't played the game before, see the registering section.</li>
<li>If you have registered, log in and carry out your buying or selling actions.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<h3>Registration</h3>
<li>Choose a username which is easy to remember.
<li>Choose a password that you don't use on other websites as they are not stored in encrypted form. Confirm your password by typing it again.</li>
<li>Supply a valid email address. We only use this for reminding you of forgotten usernames and passwords, and at no point is it disclosed to anyone else.</li>
<li>Choose a name for your spaceship and select which solar system you would like to take over. The names displayed are the star names, and each has a single inhabitable planet. This planet is one of the 3 civilizations mentioned earlier.</li>
<li>Confirm.
</ol>
<ol>
<h3>Buying goods</h3>
<li>Go to 'Universe Map'.</li>
<li>Place your mouse over one of the planets which isn't yours. If it shows that any goods are for sale and you'd like to buy them, click on the planet to travel there.</li>
<li>When your ship lands on that planet, you will be taken to the 'Trade Goods' page. Quantity boxes appear wherever it is possible to buy a resource. Type in how much of it you would like to buy. If it is possible, the transaction completes. Otherwise, you are told why it isn't.</li>
<li>Check 'Your Ship' to see whether the goods you bought have been loaded into your cargo hold.</li>
<li>If you are ready to return home, go back to 'Universe Map' and click on 'Back Home' at the bottom of the page.</li>
<li>When you've returned home, go to 'Your Ship' and click 'Unload Cargo'.</li>
<li>Go to 'Your Warehouse' to check that your resource count(s) have just increased.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<h3>Creating goods</h3>
<li>Go to 'Game Homepage'.</li>
<li>Check the tables to see if you have enough raw materials and machinery required to produce anything.</li>
<li>If so, click on one of the buttons at the bottom of the page to extract titanium, grow food etc.</li>
<li>Check that your resource levels have changed.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<h3>If you run out of fuel or mileage</h3>
<li>If you are unable to travel to another planet or back home because your ship has run out of fuel, you will need to refill the tank.</li>
<li>If your ship's mileage is too low, your ship will need reservicing.</li>
<li>For either, go to 'Your Ship'</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<h3>Selling goods</h3>
<li>Go to 'Your Warehouse'</li>
<li>In the 'Put for Sale' box, enter the quantity you wish to put on the market.</li>
<li>Other people should now be able to buy your goods automatically.</li>
<li>You may announce the release of your goods for sale through the messaging system.</li>
