1. From the line:

	  Idx Name        Size      VMA       LMA       File off  Algn
	0 .text         00000020  00000000  00000000  00000034  2**2

   it can be seen that the size is 20 (hex), which is 32 bytes.

2. There is 1 relocation record, namely:

	RELOCATION RECORDS FOR [.text]:
	OFFSET   TYPE              VALUE
	0000000b R_386_32          message

3. No relocations records remain.

4. If you use the linker on cversion, you get the following:

	sync01% ld -N cversion.o -o cversion
	ld: warning: cannot find entry symbol _start; defaulting to 0804808.
	cversion.o: In function `main':
	cversion.o(.text+0x13): undefined reference to `write'
	cversion.o(.text+0x20): undefined reference to `exit'

   When you try to list the symbols, you get the following:

   	sync01% nm cversion.o
        	 U exit
	00000000 t gcc2_compiled.
	00000000 T main
	00000000 D message
	         U write

   Basically, there is no compiled version or the 'write' and 'exit' methods   
   within access from the caller.

5. When cversion.c is compiled, it is assumed that this method might be a 		   
   callee within a more complex c program. When its code has been executed,    
   there may be more instructions from another file to be executed. So rather  
   than exit the program back to the command prompt, it only signifies         
   completion of the current method.
