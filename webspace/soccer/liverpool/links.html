Swiss youngster linked with summer move



Talented young Swiss full-back Arnaud Buhler is being linked with a summer switch to Liverpool after he impressed during a recent trial.

The Reds have an extensive European scouting network and the 18-year-old, who plays for Lausanne-Sports in his homeland, did well during a trial spell at Melwood with Gerard Houllier's side.

He also admitted he was impressed with the club's facilities and admitted it would be a "dream" move for him.

"I discovered what it would be like to play for Liverpool. I took part in training with the first team and the reserves and saw many positive things which made me dream about a successful future," he told Swiss newspaper 24 Heures.

Buhler was part of the Swiss Under-17 side which won the European Championships last summer and broke into Lausanne's first team this season, playing six times.

It is thought Houllier will keep his eye on the youngster over the next few months and he could launch a bid to bring him to Anfield during the close season.
