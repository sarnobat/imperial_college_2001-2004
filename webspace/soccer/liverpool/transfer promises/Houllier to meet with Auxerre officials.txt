
                        Houllier to meet with Auxerre officials
                        Paul Eaton 
                        Gerard Houllier will meet with Auxerre officials at the 
                        end of the month with a couple of the French clubs 
                        players likely to be at the top of the agenda. 

                        Highly rated striker Djibril Cisse and young defender 
                        Jean-Alain Boumsong are rumoured to be summer targets of 
                        Houllier, although the Liverpool boss wouldn't confirm 
                        today if either or both players are on his summer 
                        wish-list. 

                        "We will have a meeting with Auxerre at the end of the 
                        month," said the manager. "Rick Parry, the board and I 
                        are aware of the need for fresh blood but at the same 
                        time we have a good nucleus of the team. 

                        "I want to preserve that. The average age of the team is 
                        25 and it would be silly not to give the players more 
                        time. 

                        "It is natural there will be some difficult decisions 
                        ahead. I know I have to take them but that's football."
