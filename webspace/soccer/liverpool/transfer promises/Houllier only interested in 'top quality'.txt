                        Houllier only interested in ’top quality’
                        Paul Eaton 
                        Liverpool boss Gerard Houllier today admitted he's only 
                        interested in "top quality players" who are ready made 
                        for first team action when he delves into the transfer 
                        market this summer. 

                        Houllier has said he won't be spending money on talented 
                        youngsters who may need time to settle and he will 
                        instead be splashing his cash on established players who 
                        can slot into the side from day one next season. 

                        He said: "We don't need players with potential now. We 
                        need players who can come in and go straight into the 
                        team. 

                        "I'm aware that us not being in the Champions League may 
                        not make us as attractive to some players, but I also 
                        know that we don't need too much. Maybe one or two top 
                        quality players to go into the team. We need more flair, 
                        I would admit that. 

                        "We need a creative player who can provide the link 
                        between midfield and attack and we probably also need a 
                        defender as well. Stephane Henchoz, who we have missed 
                        this season, has just started running again and we hope 
                        he will be back for next season. 

                        "In an ideal world we'll sign four players in the summer 
                        because we also have to replace players who are out of 
                        contract and leaving us."
