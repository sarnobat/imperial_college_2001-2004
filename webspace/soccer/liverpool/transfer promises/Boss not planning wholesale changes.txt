                        Boss not planning wholesale changes
                        Paul Eaton 
                        Gerard Houllier reflected on his team's Champions League 
                        heartbreak and defiantly declared: "The squad doesn't 
                        need too much strengthening!" 

                        The Liverpool manager was understandably distraught 
                        after watching his side fail to grab fourth place in the 
                        final Premiership table, but he insists he has total 
                        faith in his current squad as he already starts to 
                        prepare for next season. 

                        He said: "The squad doesn't need much strengthening. It 
                        has been a hard season but what we need most now is 
                        continuity. Look what Chelsea have achieved with the 
                        same players a year on. 

                        "We beat Manchester United in the Worthington Cup final 
                        and at least we have Europe with the UEFA Cup which is 
                        good for players' experience, even though we all know 
                        the Champions League is far ahead financially. 

                        "The temptation after you have missed qualifying for the 
                        Champions League is to have a clear-out in the squad but 
                        I don't think that is always right. 

                        "We don't need to add too much. I still have faith and 
                        belief in my squad of players."
