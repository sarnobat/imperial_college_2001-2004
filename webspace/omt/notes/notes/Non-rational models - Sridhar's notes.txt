(comments in response to table on p. 168 of reading 6.1)

Bureaucratic
----------------

Satisficing - knew there was a problem with an O-Ring but didn't think it was a problem (actually, I'm not sure if this is true. Maybe they weren't aware of the problem?)


Garbage Can
----------------

Preference unclear (safety or meeting deadlines?)

The solution to their continual postponements (problem) was simply to lauch (solution); when considering to lauch without the worry of deadlines perhaps they wouldn't have launched due to safety concerns.

Unclear results and outocmes - not sure of O-ring performance below 40 degrees F (never tested below freezing)


Political
----------

Note for Dhruv: "HELP EMAIL" by Thiokol engineer. MTI managers didn't provide resources for engineers to fully investigate O-ring problem.

Disorderly decsion process - assumption that all MTI changed their minds though some really hadn't.

Information witheld - ignoring data and photographs.
