The ASP Emporium test database is provided in several formats.

	> SQL Server ( ASPEmp_All.SQL )
	  ==============================================
		* the script ASPEmp_All.SQL contains definitions for
		  every example object in the live ASP Emporium SQL
		  server. You can run this script to re-create the
		  necessary objects in your sql server to run every
		  example. Individual scripts for each example are 
		  available with each example. This script contains 
		  definitions for all objects.

	> Microsoft Access 2000 ( mydata.mdb )
	  ==============================================
		* ms access 2000 database contains all stored procedure,
		  tables and test data already in the database for every
		  example.

	> Microsoft Access 97 ( mydata_97.mdb )
	  ==============================================
		* ms access 97 database was converted from the access
		  2000 version and IS NOT SUPPORTED. It is recommended
		  that you only use this if you don't have access 2000
		  installed on your machine. It is for viewing purposes
		  only. On your server, you can use the Access 2000
		  version to run with the applications.
