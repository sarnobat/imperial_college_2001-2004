Dear Finance Soc,
Another quick e-mail to advertise an upcoming event you may be interested
in:

Lazard's "core activities are corporate finance, asset management, capital
markets and principal investing, on a global scale" (www.lazard.com)

Lazard's only London presentation next week.

Time/Date: 	6:00pm on Monday, October 15th
Location: 	Great Eastern Hotel, adjacent to Liverpool St. Station
http://www.streetmap.co.uk/streetmap.dll?P2M?P=EC2M7QN&Z=1
Contact: 	zoe.henham@lazard.com (Graduate Recruitment Manager)



Can I also take this opportunity to remind you again about Thursday's
meeting at 12pm, Mech Eng Level 7. Also if anyone you know didn't receive
the introductory e-mail and should of done (i.e. they signed up at the
fresher's fair) I do apologise, typing up 2-3 hundred e-mail addresses
without a typo is impossible! If you/they just mail me the address they want
to sign up with that would be great.
One more thing, we are also in need of a TREASURER (Ironic I know!) so if
you're interested again just let me know asap.

Kindest Regards
Chris

First of all thank you to all those who came along to the Fresher's =
Fair
stand and signed up and welcome back to all those remaining from last =
year's
mailing list.
This is just a quick introductory e-mail, no doubt I will forget to say
loads of things.

Most importantly there will be an introductory meeting on Thursday =
(11th
October) between 12pm and 1pm on level 7 in Mech Eng.

We will either meet in the foyer area outside the lifts on level 7 or =
in one
of the nearby rooms.
The purpose of this meeting is to introduce you to the society and =
answer
any questions you might have. We will also require you to pay a small
membership fee of =A33 for the year.=20
Unfortunately if you do not sign up as a full member then you will not =
be
eligible to be involved with the societies activities and will not =
recieve
e-mail notification of events etc.
If you can't make this meeting, don't worry, there will be plenty more
opportunities to sign up soon.

Just to give you a brief reminder of our remit:
We are one of your main links to jobs in the city, finance, and =
business in
general. Our activities include organising and publicising talks,
presentations and work shops with companies such as investment banks,
management consultancies, accountancy firms etc... We also produce an =
annual
magazine and in the past have created a very successful trading game.

As a member you can be involved in orgasing these events  and =
activities (as
a committee member), this is probably the most rewarding part of the =
society
as you will have the oportunity to make even closer contact with =
companies,
and perhaps even future employers!=20
We are also looking for people to take up positions on the executive
committee. In particular we are looking for someone to be our IT guru =
and
manage the website. I will speak more about committee positions at the
meeting or in further e-mails.

Hope to see you all on Thursday, if you have any questions/queries =
don't
hesitate to e-mail me.
Thanx
Chris Harvey
ICUFS president

Professor Aleksander will describe the sponsored exchange opportunities
available under the UNITECH agreement between leading Industrial Companies
and European Technical Universities.

UNITECH provides an industrial sponsorship scheme for students who spend an
exchange year at one of the participating European Institutions.

This scheme may possibly facilite exchanges that are more liberal on
language requirements than the existing agreements under the European Union
Erasmus scheme, although the course requirements of the MEng (Computing)
Europe Programme will still need to be satisfied.

The presentation will take place room 311 Huxley at 1.00pm on Monday
November 12th.

While the Unitech scheme is of particular relevance for students who are
enrolled on the European Programme, Professor Alexander would like to
encourage other students to consider the opportunity provided by UNITECH.

> Dear Finance Soc,
> (sorry this e-mail is a bit of a mammoth, but please do read on... pretty
> please!)
>
> TO ALL:
>
> First of all a quick last minute reminder of tonight's Marakon event "How
> to crack a case study".
> 6.30 in the Clore Lecture theatre, Huxley Building (Maths and Computing
> dept)
> I will be there with membership forms to capture those of you who still
> want to sign up as full members and get on the permanent mailing list.
>
> Apologies if it seems like Finance Soc hasn't been doing much in the way
> of events this term. This is partly due to the whole society basically
> having to be remade from scratch, but is mainly due to the rather too
> excellent job done by the careers service! We're looking to take a
> slightly more unique approach this year so watch this space (especially
> next term).
>
> Oh, and if you are interested in being a magazine editor please read
> below.
>
> Again I should point out that I can't always respond to all individual
> e-mails, sorry. And I also apologise to those recieving 2 or even 3 copies
> of this e-mail. The situation should gradually improve, but with almost
> 300 addresses to deal with it's impossible to iron out all the creases.
>
> Kindest Regards
>
> Chris Harvey

> Please read on below....

>
> To Those Interested in Committee Type Stuff:
>
>  <<icufs 11_01(3).xls>>
>
>  Attached to this e-mail is a spreadsheet outlining the committee
> positions (as they stand at the moment) and (on the second sheet) a list
> of companies and the allocated events organisers. Have a look to see where
> you are. Hopefully these are to everyone's satisfaction. The allocation of
> companies has been fairly random, unfortunately it's not possible to
> account for everyone's preferences. We can't have 20 people all contacting
> Goldman Sachs! If you have any major problems with the allocation sheet,
> please let me know (for example you are listed but don't want to be, or
> want to be listed as an events organiser and are not). Also let me know if
> there are any companies I have missed off, or any mergers I haven't taken
> account of, it's a fairly old list!
>
>  You will also notice two holes in the exec committee, Chief Events
> Organiser, and Magazine Editor. Those of you who have contacted me and put
> yourself forwards for the position of CEO (nice title), I think I have you
> all noted down somewhere (you may find CEO after your name on the
> spreadsheet). I think we will have to see how successful you guys are at
> organising events before we make a decision on who gets the job (hint
> hint!), again it may come down to a vote.
>  As for Magazine Editor, the situation is a little more urgent as we
> usually publish at the beginning of the next term. It would be good to
> have the majority of the magazine ready to go by Christmas.
>  I did this job last year, it was pretty good fun and you get to do some
> graphic design type stuff too.
> VOLUNTEERS PLEASE (by next week).
>
>  For those of you who are events organisers.
>
> Unfortunately there hasn't been much opportunity to do events this term,
> companies and the careers service have saturated the timetable. Hence my
> rather delayed action in getting you guys up and running.
>  As there is now quite going on in terms of company events and various
> business societies we have to find a slightly more unique angle this year.
> (SIS are concentrating on skills workshops, so we should try to stay away
> from that area)
> SUGGESTIONS WELCOME
> Some ideas I had were:
> *	An open Q&A forum with a number of different people from Banks,
> Management Consulting Firms, Brokers etc etc.
> *	A Q&A session with some students, eg those who have been on
> internships etc.
> *	More business games (not necessarily having to involve any companies
> at all)
>
> To those who are already involved in organising things, or were doing it
> last year:
> Get stuck in!
>
> To those a new to this kind of thing:
> First look at the company web site to find out what they do and to get
> some contact info (usually the UK recruiting department or head of
> recruiting).
> BUT, before you contact any companies please e-mail me to let me know what
> you are planning. It's important that we contact companies in a
> professional manner and don't tread on anyone's toes (the careers service
> for example).
>
> Last year we had a problem with people sitting on Events Organiser
> committee positions, but not really doing much in the way of events or
> organising! Because there are a lot of people out there who would like the
> chance to get their foot in the door I can't let people do this. I know it
> won't always be possible to get the companies to be co-operative with us,
> but I would like to see evidence that you have tried. Sorry if that seems
> a bit militant, I'm not that bad, honest... well not much.
>
> More guidance will follow...

Dear Sridhar,

If you weren't able to visit one of our university presentations, now's
your chance!

This week we're holding a Virtual Presentation and you can visit us
anytime between Wednesday, 28 November midday to Friday, 30 November
midday at the address below.

The presentation will answer the question, "So what does Reuters do?"

Using a real life case study we show you that when events move markets,
the financial world depends on Reuters to report the news, deliver the
data and  make the trades.

What's more, the presentation puts into context how our graduates fit into
what we do.

There's still a month to go before the closing date for our Graduate
Programmes, so this could be the ideal opportunity for you to get
acquainted with us.  Or if you're already creating your application you
can gain some additional valuable insights.

Make a date in your diary, come to the presentation and find out why so
many in the financial markets think, "Reuters - the power of fact."

See you sometine between Wednesday and Friday.

Regards,

The Reuters Graduate Team.

Dear Sridhar,

The Recruitment and Employment Confederations January job report shows an
increase in the number of people doing temporary work. Apparently many
school leavers and graduates view temping as a perfect way of learning
about the workplace.

Increasingly, school leavers are taking a gap year to do exactly this.
Some use this time to choose whether they want to break straight into the
job market or embark on a university degree course. For those choosing the
latter, many find that the skills acquired in their temporary positions
(which may well have been supplemented by working throughout the holidays)
can be the deciding factor when it comes to securing that all-important
first employment position after their studies. Still others are choosing
to temp after graduation, seizing a last opportunity to size up the job
market.

Other graduates and undergraduates wishing to enhance their CVs with an
impressive skills set are turning to training, with more and more prepared
to finance it themselves. According to Learndirect, set up by the
government in 2000 to help employees boost their skills, lack of
confidence in the job market has encouraged an unprecedented number to
enrol on vocational courses.

Ann Limb, the chief executive of LearnDirect, commented: In January last
year we had 9,500 enrolments. This January the figure had shot up to
34,000. Many people in jobs feel they should have a higher level of skills
as an insurance policy in case they should need to look elsewhere  and
are prepared to pay for them themselves.

There are, however, still plenty of companies out there that are looking
for candidates just like you.  Read on to find out about some graduate
opportunities that match your Milkround criteria.
