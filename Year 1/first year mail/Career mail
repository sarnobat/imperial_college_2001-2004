Time: 6.00pm
Location: IEE, Savoy Place
 
FREE admission with food and drinks
*****************************************

Introduced for the first time last year the Multi-Disciplinary Night (MDN) is
an essential event for personal development. MDN is an event that we have
organised to highlight the "real world" skills that modern, professional
engineers need, such as presentation and time management.
 
The skill workshops are presented in a fun and interactive fashion and will
include sessions ranging from CV critique to problem solving. There will be
many hands-on activities for you to participate in, competing with other
students and young engineers. We will also show you where to go for further
information or training on each skill area highlighted.
 
The workshops will be followed by a networking buffet where there will be 
free food and drink and the chance to talk with fellow students, 
industrialists and representatives from the sponsoring companies. 

Please note that you NEED to register for this event via our website at
http://www.ieelym.org.uk/register.php?event=mdn
 
A group will be leaving from the foyer on the 2nd floor of the Electrical
Engineering building at 5.30pm on the Monday, alternatively you can make your
own way to the IEE building (nearest tube embankment, directions can be found 
at http://www.ieelym.org.uk/information.php?info=savoy).

Look forward to seeing you there.

The SNAP (Stanford Nanosecond Arithmetic Processor) Project

Professor Michael J. Flynn
Computer Systems Laboratory
Stanford University

Friday 1st March 2002 at 12.00, in Room 418, Huxley Building:

For more  than  a decade  the SNAP  project  has pioneered  advances  in
arithmetic  algorithms  and high speed  VLSI clocking.  Fast  arithmetic
drives modern digital technology enabling high performance  3D graphics,
efficient wireless communications and multimedia applications.

This talk covers  some  of the SNAP  highlights:  "wave"  or latch  less
pipelining,  measures of the area-time product of arithmetic algorithms,
advances  in particular  arithmetic  algorithms.  Some current  work  on
high-speed execution of the higher level (analytic)  functions will also
be discussed.

Michael Flynn was design manager at IBM.  In 1975 he became Professor of
Electrical Engineering  at Stanford University,  and was Director of the
Computer Systems Laboratory from 1977 to 1983.  He was founding chairman
of both the ACM Special Interest Group on Computer Architecture  and the
IEEE Computer Society's  Technical  Committee  on Computer Architecture.
Professor  Flynn was the 1992 recipient  of the ACM/IEEE Eckert-Mauchley
Award for his technical  contributions  to computer  and digital systems
architecture.  He was  the 1995  recipient  of the IEEE-CS  Harry  Goode
Memorial  Award in recognition  of his outstanding  contribution  to the
design and classification of computer architecture.

Philips are looking for a summer placement student (details attached
below). Due to the uncertainty Philips have been facing, some students
may have already applied and been sent a regret letter purely due to the
fact that they did not know whether there would be any summer placements
available - I have been asked to encourage those students to apply again
for this position.

Best wishes

Teresa

Philips are looking for a summer placement student (details attached
below). Due to the uncertainty Philips have been facing, some students
may have already applied and been sent a regret letter purely due to the
fact that they did not know whether there would be any summer placements
available - I have been asked to encourage those students to apply again
for this position.

Best wishes

Teresa

Language and Architecture for System Design

Masahiro Fujita
University of Tokyo

This talk covers two topics. First, we present the SpecC language
and its design  methodology.  SpecC is based on the C programming
language targetting system level design.  It covers both hardware
and software  aspects  of embedded  system designs.  We introduce
SpecC  version  2.0  and its associated  design  methodology  for
embedded systems.

Second,   we  introduce  a  field  modifilable  architecture  and
its design  methodology,  which  enables  system  design  without
logic  synthesis.  Recent  semiconductor  technology  can realize
ultra  large  scale  integration   and  high  performance  signal
processing with a single chip.  It can easily implement real-time
MPEG  decoding,  complicated  data  encryption  and other  signal
processings   on  silicons.   We  introduce  a  hardware/software
co-design  methodology  which  shortens  the  time-to-market  and
enables design debugging after fabrication of silicon chips.

Masahiro Fujita received  Doctor in Engineering  (PhD)  on formal
verification  method from the University  of Tokyo in 1985.  Then
he joined Fujitsu  Laboratories  Japan as a member of researching
staff. From 1988 to 1989, he is a visiting researcher at Computer
Science department in University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
In 1993, he was assigned to Fujitsu Laboratories of America where
he managed  a research  group on computer-aided  design for VLSI.
In 2000,  he joined the department  of electronic engineering  in
the University of Tokyo as a professor.  Also he is now the chair
of the Language  Specification  working  group for C-based system
level description language, SpecC.  His research interest include
specification, synthesis and verification of VLSI designs.

I have received the details below of an internship opportunity in Hong Kong
this summer, from a former tutee of mine.

If you are interested I suggest you contact him directly by email.

Margaret Cunningham





Job is quite simple: I am looking for someone with either native or very
fluent English who is willing to spend the summer working on getting a
Linux server up, talking to my Netware 6 box (unreconstructed, see!),
show me whats what with Linux as I have not played with it yet - Netware
makes my money - and then to get up web sites for the Hong Kong Human
Powered Vehicle Association, Skywalker Children's Books Ltd, SB Systems
Consulting Ltd, Shirley Boyde Trust, boyde.net, The Association of Round
Tables in Hong Kong, Round Table 10, and Old Uncle Tom Cobbley... Well,
not the last one. Web server would be Apache on the Caldera Linux
release with NDS. Want the sites to be php based - intend to lean on a
friend to get templates for the charity sites.

Job I anticipate would last 8 - 10 weeks.

Job would not suit a teetotaller who wants to work 9-5. Job would suit
someone in possession of a HK ID card (no work permit otherwise so
non-starter) who has a nodding aquaintance with beer. If the bod was
interested in sailing as well there is a chance of a regular yacht
through the summer!

Salary offered is commensurate with other student summer intern
positions in HK  - ie HKD 6000/month.

Dear All,

Following my chat to second years earlier this week about Industrial
Placements, I would just like to stress how important it is to try and
gain some relevant experience if you plan to take a summer job. This is
particularly true if you are planning to do the MEng course. In the
present climate, companies, more and more often, are seeking students
with some relevant experience when considering them for their 6 month
placement. It's good to be able to include any such experience on your
CV. This is true not only for MEng but also for BEng students when
seeking jobs on graduation.

Best wishes

Teresa

Java Skills UK, is a new website that aims to utilise the skills of computing students and media production / graphic design students. It is due to the demand of e-commerce skills that these students can find themselves with plenty of projects that could be undertaken by them, and give them real-time knowledge and growth of skills. There is a lack of computing professionals in this country, and most students will be highly sought after graduation. Before they graduate, they have time to integrate their course work or projects with real-world economic needs. Small businesses will find it worthwhile to sell their products using the internet, and need someone to construct a working web site. Here is where students can play their part.

This site is very student-directed, and understands their interests. Students will need to look at the courses that have been chosen as suitable, at the universities shown on the map of England, and assert that they are studying one of these, or one that includes the course. The student will have a valid university email, and will use this when entering the site. They will choose what type of student they are, either being  that of computing or design, and they must know which type they are. They are tested on their knowledge of their respective skill, and these tests are varied depending on what skills they believe they have. One important reason for this is to gauge their belief with their actual skill. For computing students, they have to answer a minimum number of questions about the Java language, and for design students it is about HTML, and if the student's working knowledge of these is not sufficient, they will soon be caught out.

The site is not all tied in with combining academic and economic pursuits, and allows students on these courses to discuss university matters with one another. Computing students need a bit of lightening up sometimes, and this site is a sight for sore eyes.


The site is now live at http://www.javaskills.co.uk/jsp/forStudents

In the online java test, few students have scored higher than half marks.

If your course is a mixture of web design and programming, you will need to opt whether to progress as a programmer or designer. There is an online map of the available courses to help you choose.

I suggest you talk to Derek Brough (drb@doc.ic.ac.uk) who is the Departmental
Careers Advisor. Your problem is, I think, that the economy is down and
consequently this is having quite a knock-on effect for students trying to find
summer jobs in IT. Search on the web, especially the banks.

We don't organise summer placements for any students - only the 6 month
placements which are part of the MEng course. Try to talk to Derek as to which
companies are recruiting, which is usually a good sign that they may take on
students for the summer.

Best wishes

Teresa

Many areas of modern science already rely on large computational
resources and the manipulation of very large datasets. Access to
these computational resources and data sources by individual
e-scientists will be through enabling 'grid' middleware.

The London e-Science Centre in the Department of
Computing (http://www.lesc.ic.ac.uk/) is one of eight regional centres
within the UK e-Science Core Programme created to support the 
development of e-Science in the applied science communities. As part of 
our research activities we are developing a next generation software 
middleware to support e-science within Imperial College.

As part of this work we are looking for several summer students to 
undertake projects within the Centre. These projects include:
   - e-science portals (with access to remote data & storage resources
     and desktop tools)
   - Peer-to-peer service federation (e.g. through Jxta)

Students should ideally have experience in (or a willingness to learn
about) one or more of the following:
	- Portals using Java servlets
	- Web services (SOAP & WSDL)
	- Jxta (or other peer-to-peer infrastructures)

The software will initially be deployed in a mixed Linux and Solaris
environment across a range of high-end computing platforms and PC
clusters. This provides and ideal opportunity to experience working
within a large active research group in a dynamic and challenging
research area.

The employment is for 10 weeks over the summer paying £250
a week. Further details of the UROP scheme can be found
http://www.urop.ic.ac.uk/. For further information about this work and 
applying for the posts please contact Dr Steven Newhouse 
(s.newhouse@doc.ic.ac.uk) citing any relevant experience.

Dear all,

If you are good at SQL, JSP/ASP, and HTML, please let me know if you are
interested in a summer job in creating a dynamic web site for managing
research data and publishing research results for our research group and
collaborators. It is not just web and database design and you will learn
some new stuff as well. You will need some prior experience in all of the
areas above, ie, SQL, JSP and HTML. It is possible that this may lead
towards a long term position.

Salary is competitive and depends on experience. Please email me directly if
you are interested.

Best wishes
