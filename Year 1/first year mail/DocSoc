Hi dudes,

Our project group has spent the past 3 months redesigning the
departments website. It has now come to the point where we feel it is
ready for a beta test.

The beta of the DoC site is up at:
http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/project/2001/ug3/g2001ug09/backend/rendered/

We would appreciate any comments and bugs found, which can be submitted
by the 'bug report' tab on the site.

Important stuff for you to think about is what links you would like for
your groups homepage. Only being CS3 students we don't really know what
sort of stuff you other guys use most.

The site attempts to automatically work out who you are by the computer
you are using in labs. We expect this to still be a little buggy. If you
have any problems with the site detecting you as the wrong person let us
know. You can check who you are by going to the personalised timetable
page.

One more little point before we bore you to death :) We have implemented
a wap version of the timetable and people search. You can view this at:

http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/project/2001/ug3/g2001ug09/backend/rendered/wapwork/index.wml

Please let us know if you have any problems with the wap site and the
make of your mobile.

The site is for you so let us know what you think and improvements you
think could be implemented.

Enjoy

Joseph Wilk (Project manager)

Dear All,

* What is an FSA?
* What is ICU?
* How do they affect you?
* What does the DepRep do?

Ash (DepRep) and I (that's me Paul, DoCSoc Chairman), will be holding a
really informal meeting/talk this Friday 8th February, at 12:30pm in
room 308. We will try and answer some of these questions as well as any
you might care to bring along. We will discuss the upcoming elections,
how they work, what the timetable is. I will talk about DoCSoc, news so
far this year, how you can play a bigger role in the society, and
discuss ways in which we can take the society forward. Ash will talk
about being DepRep and how this role will change next year.

We also want to know how you feel about DoC and about the Union. Have
college done enough to explain what this new faculty business is about?
Do you feel isolated from the Union and other aspects of college life;
if so why?

Everyone is welcome. It will be a really informal chat, with as many
questions and answers as you care to ask. Anyone wishing to stand for
positions within DoCSoc, the new faculty structure or the Union is
welcome also; Ash and I will try and answer any questions you have.
Please feel free to drop by, if only for a few minutes: we will not be
offended if you walk out half way through :-)

Summary details:

	Friday 8th February, 2002
	Room 308
	12:30pm


ON THE NOTE OF ELECTIONS I MUST INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING ANNOUNCEMENT:

====================================

Nomination papers for the City & Guilds / Faculty of Engineering
elections have now been put up in all departments.

The posts of President, VP (Activities), VP (Finance & Societies)
HonSec, Inter-departmental Activities Officer, the Academic Affairs
Officers and  the Dep Reps are now all open for election. Elections for
DoCSoc positions are happening concurrently.

In addition, because of the new faculty structure, you will have a
chance to "elect" a new name for the Faculty of Engineering Students
Association (City & Guilds College Union).

Further details available from http://www.cgcu.net/elections/ or by
contacting the returning officer, Mustafa Arif via president@cgcu.net

=====================================

Please, if any of the above is not clear, get back to me.

Kind regards,



Paul Jolly

Dear All,

As you will have seen from my last mail, Ash and I will be giving a
talk and answering questions about elections, DoC, faculties and ICU
etc... this Friday 8th February at 12:30pm in room 308.

It has been pointed out that this clashes with a topics lecture that
you have. Please feel free to come along after the topics lecture. Ash
and I will remain behind as long as there are questions :-)

Can I take this  opportunity to encourage as many of you as possible to
try and take an active role in DoCSoc, the Union, the faculty,
whatever! It is really worth while, and is valuable experience. Better
than that, it is really good fun :-)

Kind regards,


Paul

Dear All,

The Great Egg Race 2002 has finally been finalised (English usage
interesting). It will take place next Wednesday, 13th February after
Lunch from the Queens tower and Mech Eng.

You have to construct a flying contraption to carry a single egg from
The Queen's Tower to the safety of terra firma. Enter as a team of 5.
Tools and materials are supplied.

Entrance Forms
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Entrance forms can be collected from me, Paul, in CSG Systems 225 Huxley
(don't worry, we don't bite (except Eion)). In return for an entrance
form, you must hand over the princely sum of =A35.

Alternatively, get the application form online:

http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/docsoc/index.php?page_name=3Degg_race_2002

fill it out and bring it to me in Room 225 Huxley with you cash entry fee.


* The Prizes *
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Apart from the FREE FOOD, there will be a very grand trophy for the
winners. Plus, Felix will probably run an article (not sure whether that
is a prize), and media machine Live! might grind into action.


=2E... and afterwards?
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Afterwards there will be a Paper Dart competition, and the person who
gets their paper dart to stay in the air the longest wins. (entry fee is
=A31 per person for as many darts as you can make with materials
provided).

Kind regards,


Paul

Dear All,

Thomas is away this weekend so I will try and fill you in on as many of
the details as is possible.

As yet we do not have any dates for the matches, however C&G have said
that the first match should be over by the end of next week. C&G have
asked that we find out how many teams we are likely to want to supply.
Can you each let me know whether you have a team together already or
are looking to join a team?

Any questions, get back to me.

Cheers,



Paul

Dear All,

How does DoC's online Exam system work? What security holes are there,
and how could they be exploited to cheat in exams? Is it possible for
computers to be more secure and reliable than pen and paper?

Mike Wyer, systems programmer in CSG and main Lexis developer, discusses
the issues and technologies involved in developing and deploying Lexis.
This is a preview of the talk he will be presenting to the 15th LISA
conference in San Diego in December.

Date: Wednesday 14th November
Time: 14:00
Room: 308 Huxley

Dear Exam Students,

(Again sorry to non-exam students. Must create that list :-)

Please register your interest BEFORE MONDAY 25th 9am! We need to
finalise numbers so that we can send the booklets to Docunet. After
next Monday, the only delay will be with Docunet; they are normally
excellent. I will keep you updated.

========================================================================

Apologies for some students spamming the list earlier. Suitable measures
have been taken to avoid this happening in the future :-)

Kind regards,


Paul

Dear All Exam Students,

(Damn list, I stand by my promise I will fix this over the summer :-)

I would seem that there has been a great deal of confusion over the
DoCSoc exam past paper scheme. This mail tries to clear up the details.

The docsoc-students mailing list was created so that people could
un-subscribe should they not want to receive my rambling emails. This
list was abused twice in one day by two students, so with the help of
Mike Wyer, we closed the list. This move suffered some config file
errors which caused some mails to back up on the server. This resulted
in some people not receiving my first mail about registering for past
papers. My second mail, an update on past papers, suffered similar
problems and was delivered today, three days late. As the printers
required numbers for the booklets, I had to close the registration
period on Monday morning. Hence the confusion with the second mail
arriving today.

My sincere apologies for this confusion. It is partly my fault. The
scheme was started very late this year and has not worked as smoothly as
I would have liked. Next year, I intend to have the booklets ready
before the beginning of the autumn term so that third years have the
papers when they need them. The booklets will also be free, being funded
by company sponsorship (of which I have some) and department subsidy
(cause they should be contributing in any case).

Once again, I am very sorry that people have been left out in this
scheme.

Kind regards,


Paul

Dear All,

This is to clear up all the questions that people have. Not that I mind,
but today I have received 50 emails from people asking fairly similar
questions so here goes on clearing up the points they address.

1. Registration for the past paper booklets has ended. This means that
those who did not register via the web interface cannot be guaranteed a
booklet. Those who did register, you are assured of a booklet. Sorry
about all the confusion over this (as mentioned in my last mail); the
rush job this year was not my ideal plan, but the department do not
want to help / be a part of this scheme at all.

2. For those who are now left without past papers, the ps files are
available from the following location (DoC login only):

https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/docsoc/exams/

This is the suggested format. These will work using lpr under Linux. For
example:

lpr -Predshift blah.ps

However, if you want the pdf format:

https://soroban.doc.ic.ac.uk/exams/

Note that trying to print these files via lpr under Linux will result in
much crap coming out of the printer. Either print from acrobat reader or
acroread and you should be fine.

3. For those who did register via the web interface, the papers are
ready (well almost). For CS1, CS2, CS3, CS4, your papers can be
collected on Monday 4th and Wednesday 6th March from room 308 between
13:00 and 14:00. I  will mail ISE, JMC, MSc and MAC students
individually (ie those who registered) giving details of when they can
pick up the booklets. The cost, as stated previously, is =A32.

4. The deadline for collecting the booklets will be Friday 8th March.
People who do not collect booklets by 5pm on this day, will not be
guaranteed booklets, even if you registered for them.

5. If there are any papers left after the deadline, I will sell them on
a first come first served basis. I will confirm numbers remaining in a
mail after the deadline.

Thanks for your patience.

Kind regards,


Paul

Dear All,

Date:      Thursday 13th June
Location:  Beit Quad (Union)

** NO TICKETS REQUIRED **

C&G's own Catering team will be providing a high quality selection of
burgers, hot dogs etc at ridiculously low prices - i.e. we aim to be a
lot more price competitive than the ICU barbecues!  I'll send you an
email confirming pricing soon.

Everyone (I mean everyone!!!) is welcome to come along, and pay per item
for food.  Drinks will be available from the Union Bar.

... it's a great chance to celebrate the end of the exams of course!

See you there!
