There will be a revision lecture for my half of the database course on

  15:00  Tuesday 26th March

  room 311


I don't want to say the same thing twice, so this is open to 1st year
and 2nd year students (it was the same course). I hope you can all cram
in. I'm assuming you won't all turn up.

For those of you who can't make it: I have prepared a model answer, with
commentary, of the assessed coursework exercise and will put this on the
course website

http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~mjs/teaching/databases

as soon as I finish typing it all in.

As you may know, the delay in return of your assessed coursework was
caused by logistical problems in allocating markers. I hope these are
resolved; your coursework will be returned asap. In the meantime, the
model answer should serve for revision purposes. (By the way, the
questions --- particularly question 2 on relational algebra queries ---
are much more difficult/complicated than you would get in an
examination.)
