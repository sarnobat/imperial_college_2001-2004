Dear Computing-1 and JMC-1 students,

Haskell Examination in 2002
---------------------------

You will know by now that you are to sit a Haskell exam on

                Friday 11 January

For Comp-1 this is the first half of your formal examination for the
Declarative Programming course - the second half on Prolog is examined in
the Summer Term.

For JMC-1 the exam contributes credit to your labwork.

The Haskell exam will take place in the labs - Huxley 202/207/219.

Formally, it begins at 11.30 and lasts for 90 minutes. It will be similar
in this respect to a Driving Test, being controlled by the LEXIS system.


HOWEVER: you are permitted (and strongly advised) to enter the labs at
11.00, because you will then be able to read the question paper and plan
your answers to it, ready for implementation when LEXIS opens at 11.30.

So, this preliminary 30 minutes is analogous to the 20-minute planning
phase granted in a Driving Test. Any writing you do during this time is to
be done only in special Answer Books that will be provided for you. These
will be subsequently collected in by the invigilators. The assessment,
however, is based upon the programs submitted by you through LEXIS from
11.30 onwards.

SUMMARY: the formal start-time is 11.30, but you should actually come
         at 11.00 to take advantage of the informal planning phase.

Regards,
Chris.

Dear Computing-1 students,

Xmas Test - Thursday December 13th
----------------------------------

I have already sent you some advice on this, and most details are on your
web noticeboard.

The test is intended to begin at 10.00 sharp in Huxley 308+311.
Do not enter these rooms until the invigilators say you can.

The Question Papers and Answer Books will be already laid out at
appropriately-spaced sitting positions. Sit at any one you like.
Do not write anything at this stage.

At each position there will also be a single sheet of paper. When the test
is announced to begin, first PRINT your name and login on this sheet. It
will be collected by the invigilators as the test gets underway in order to
check attendance.

You will have three identical Answer Books to be used as follows:

	- one for your answers to Questions 1 and 2
	- one for your answers to Questions 3 and 4
	- one for your answer  to Question  5

On the front cover of each one, PRINT your name and the numbers of those
questions you have answered in it.

The purpose of the multiple answer books is to facilitate concurrent
marking by the various examiners, so that we can get the results back to
you in the Spring Term faster than would otherwise be the case.

Take special note of the instructions issued earlier:

	- you must bring no supporting materials
	- you must leave all bags, coats, etc. at the side of the room
	- you must maintain silence once you are seated
	- you must not bring any calculators, laptops or MOBILE PHONES *
	- you must not bring any writing paper with you

* Anyone who allows a mobile phone to ring during the test will
  automatically get zero marks and be fined =A310,000, payable to me.

Regards,
Chris.
