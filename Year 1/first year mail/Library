Dear Sridhar Sarnobat

You will receive an ATHENS username and password from the sender "Sybase".
Please do not delete this.  It is vital for finding information on your
subject.

Every member of the College is issued with a personal ATHENS username and
password. These may be used to access various web based library resources
eg: Web of Science http://wos.mimas.ac.uk and Cambridge Scientific Abstracts
http://www.csa1.co.uk/.  (For lists of library electronic resources see
http://www.lib.ic.ac.uk/nwdata.htm and
http://www.lib.ic.ac.uk/ejournals/ejnls.htm .)

Please do not delete the message with your ATHENS details as you will
require them for literature searching.

Your ATHENS username and password are linked to your Imperial College email
username. You will receive your ATHENS username via email from "Sybase", 2-3
weeks after receiving your College email address. Enquiries about your
ATHENS username and password should be directed to department/campus library
staff or emailed to Electronic Information Services at eis@ic.ac.uk.

>> The library has purchased a three-year site licence for Reference Manager

>> training in their use.
>>
>> Use of the software eases the burden of researching and writing.  These
>> programs are designed to enable you to create your own personalised
>> databases by extracting references from major databases such as
>> Medline/PubMed, ISI Web of Science, INSPEC, etc.  An extensive range of
>> pre-defined output formats, such as Harvard or approved styles of academic
>> journals, are built into the software.  EndNote and Reference Manager are
>> already widely used in College and interest in their availability and use
>is
>> growing.
>>
>> You may download the latest versions of the software, Reference Manager
>9.5
>> and EndNote 5, from the ICT, IT Services (previously CCS) website at
>> <http://www.ict.ic.ac.uk/softwareshop/> for which you will be required to
>> enter your IC username and password.  The software may be installed on any
>> IC-owned or operated machine but users must complete a registration form,
>> before downloading the software.
>>
>> Those who already use these packages and wish to upgrade to the latest
>> version may visit the same website and follow the procedures.
>>
>> The library has organised training sessions for the Windows versions of
>> Reference Manager and EndNote starting November 2001. For more details
