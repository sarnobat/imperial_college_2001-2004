Hi there,

If you're reading this email then you signed your name up to the ICTBC
mailing list at Fresher's Fair.
If you do not want to remain on this list, contact
secretary.ic@muppetmasters.com.

Wednesday's 1st bowling session of the season starts at 1.30pm outside the
union building on Prince Consort Road.
Don't worry, we shall be VERY obvious in our purple shirts and with our
bowling pin held high.

As we mentioned at the Fair, it doesn't matter what your ability is, or how
seriously you want to take it, we only go bowling for you to have fun, so
please come along and do just that!

The coach will arrive outside the union at 1.45pm and we should get to the
bowling alley at about 2.30pm. On the coach we'll explain a little more
about the club and what we have lined up for the coming season.

Once more, for those who can't make the first session, please please don't
be put off, you can come on any Wednesday, although remember that the WIN A
BOWLING BALL competition ends on the THIRD week, (that of the 17th Oct.)

The fun doesn't stop after bowling, either - those who want to can return
with us to Southside Bar where new member will receive a little gift from
the club, either in the form of FREE BEER, or FREE PIZZA (to be decided), so
come on down.

Hopefully see you on Wednesday,

Will Britton [ICTBC Secretary].
