You are over your disk quota on your home directory on falcon - use 'quota -v'
from any Linux PC to check your quota.  Your disk quota is currently:

             usage  quota  limit     timeleft   files  quota  limit    timeleft
ss401     +- 102472 100000 110000    6.3 days    1662  10000  11000            

You must delete sufficient files to get under quota before the time column
reaches zero.  After that time, you will not be able to create any new files at
all without coming to see us in room 220 or 225.

Alternatively, if you have a genuine reason for needing more quota, please
email your quota request to help and we'll consider it.

Just a quick reminder that the department buys printers for academic use.

Using the printers for non-academic work greatly inconveniences other
users, so please avoid doing so.

We would very much prefer not to have to introduce a quota system for
printng -- it's a big hassle for everyone...

Dear all,

We have commissioned 2 brand new Canon IR3300 printers.

One is the large lab (H219) and is called REDSHIFT and the other
is in H206 and is called BLUESHIFT.

These printers are capable of A4 printing, with facilities to do double sided printing,
stapling and hole punching (for ring binders).

Please see http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/csg/printers/
for details on how to use them from Windows 2000 and Linux/Unix.

The units are not intended to be used as photocopiers - although
they come equipped as such as standard (and it cannot be removed
physically). Photocopying is not allowed and has been disabled in software.
Copying is available in the technical library for small jobs and, of course, at various
places on campus for larger jobs. Unfortunately, we cannot allow *unregulated*
copying which is why it's disabled.

We are expecting to order some more (smaller) printers for the labs later
once costing calculations have been done.

Please be nice to the new printers - we hope they will give good reliable service for 3 
years. Please note some points in particular:

* Please report faults to CSG via the helpdesk or help@doc.ic.ac.uk. Do not try to fix 
problems yourself.

* When printed pages are coming out on to the left paper tray, please do not touch or 
otherwise handle the pages in that job - doing so can cause printer jams and mess up 
someone else's printout. When a single print job is complete, it will be pushed out 
10cm further by the printer. You can safely remove it then.

* To look for your printout, please remove all completed pages (as per previous point) 
and take them to a nearby table and leave other people's printouts in a neat pile.

Following these guidelines will prolong the printer's life and make it easier for everyone 
to find their work.

*BUGS* 

We are aware of a few issues:

* Some MS Word documents with unusual fonts may not print at all. If you get an error 
page containing the work "invalid font", then try changing the fonts in your document.

* Linux can only accept pure postscript or text for printing. Please use acrobat reader 
to print PDFs or the appropriate application in other cases.

Please feel free to report any problems to help@doc.ic.ac.uk - there is some work still 
to be done, but the printers are capable of handling all your academic work quickly and 
reliably.

Many thanks

Tim Southerwood

Your request #5730 was resolved by ecm99:

As requested, I've cc'ed this to cs-first year. I've had a look, 
and here's the solution:
Step-by-step instructions:
 - In Internet Explorer, select Internet Options... from the 
Tools menu.
 - Select the Security tab
 - Click on the Custom Level button (just above the OK button)
 - Under Download unsigned ActiveX controls, change to Prompt
 - Under Initialize and script ActiveX controls not marked as 
safe, change to Prompt
Then you can view your VRML pages happily (if prompted about 
ActiveX controls, select Yes - to get rid of the prompt, change 
the settings above to Enable rather than Prompt).
To check to see if the plugin is set up correctly, go to 
http://cic.nist.gov/vrml/vbdetect.html.
To view vrml (.wrl) files, open them with Internet Explorer - 
right-click on the file, and select Open With... - then choose 
Internet Explorer from the list that appears. One last bit of 
advice - the plugin does seem to be *slightly* unstable 
(certainly on my machine at home), so I'd recommend saving stuff 
reglarly.
Regards,

Your request #5716 was updated by ecm99:

Try embedding it into html, then? Blaxxun, as an ActiveX plugin, 
may require/want html files (or try opening the .wrl in IE). 
Unfortunately, the non-ActiveX viewers (Cortona et al.) couldn't 
easily be packaged. Blaxxun was the only one I could get working.

Have you checked that it is not already there?
Change your ActiveX settings as your supervisor (oskar) should 
have told you, and then, to test the plugin, go to:
http://cic.nist.gov/vrml/vbdetect.html
in Internet Explorer. I think you will find that a viewer is, in

Hello everyone,

We need to take the home directory fileserver (falcon) down for a spot of
preventative maintenance on WEDNESDAY (tomorrow) evening from 6pm onwards.
We suspect that the work will take about an hour, but can't guarantee a
specific end-time.  If anyone knows of an absolutely vital reason why this
can't go ahead tomorrow, please let us know ASAP, but we have been trying to
schedule a suitable time since the end of term!  Obviously we need to do the
work out of term time to minimise disruption, but the need to work around
various Easter events - such as the Tools2002 conference and an intensive
Industrial MSc lecture course - has made planning this a little tricky.

We therefore request that everyone log off their machines by, say, 5:30pm
tomorrow, and that you all stay off your machines - making no home directory
access at all, including (for instance) trying to read email from home -
for the rest of the evening.  Normal service will be resumed later in the
evening - details will be posted on the CSG news webpage
(http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/csg/) when the upgrade is completed.

If you like to know all the details, we are going to upgrade the RAID
controller's firmware to the latest release, which we hope will stop the
intermittent "network freezes" some of you may have noticed.  After a lot
of investigation, we tracked the cause of the "freezes" down to falcon's
RAID array mysteriously "locking up" or "freezing" for 30-60 seconds at a
time.  We believe that the firmware upgrade is an effective cure for this
problem.

cheers

Hello everyone,

Quick reminder - please finish your work and log out of all networked computer
systems which make access to your home directories before 6pm THIS EVENING (45
minutes away as I write this email!), and then do not attempt to make any
access to your home directory for the rest of the evening.

As previously stated, we need to take the home directory fileserver (falcon)
down for a spot of preventative maintenance. We suspect that the work will
take about an hour, but can't guarantee a specific end-time.

Normal service will be resumed later in the evening - details will be posted

completed and it's safe to log back in.

Dear All,

This morning an uniterruptable power supply (UPS) failed causing 6 servers to 
lose power.

5 servers were restored fairly quickly. The sixth server, GYR, is refusing to 
boot. The result of this is many of you will have difficulty logging on to 
the Windows 2000 domain as GYR holds the profiles.

The time to fix is unknown due to the difficulty in diagnosing an unbootable
Win2K server (no single user mode or boot CD).

We are working as quickly as possible to restore the service.

As the people who do are trying to use Windows 2000 will not see this message
immediately, I would appreciate it if you could show this message to anyone 
near you who seems to be having difficulties.

Many thanks

Yours,

Tim Southerwood

Dear All,

GYR (MS Profile Server) is now running after a *lot* of persuasion.

We will need to undertake some diagnostics on this
in conjunction with Microsoft later - we will advise
later.

Cheers

Hi Folks, sorry if this doesn't concern you, or you already know about it,
but I have stopped sharing stuff normally. You must now connect to my
computer by going to http://129.31.24.13

Enjoy...

- Nick (aka plop90)

You are over your disk quota on your home directory on falcon - use 'quota -v'
from any Linux PC to check your quota.  Your disk quota is currently:

             usage  quota  limit     timeleft   files  quota  limit    timeleft
ss401     +- 109992 100000 110000    6.3 days    1834  10000  11000            

You must delete sufficient files to get under quota before the time column
reaches zero.  After that time, you will not be able to create any new files at
all without coming to see us in room 220 or 225.

Alternatively, if you have a genuine reason for needing more quota, please
email your quota request to help and we'll consider it.
