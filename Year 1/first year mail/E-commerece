hello people

i have more information about the mobile phone offer from genie and also 
about this weeks lectures, which i thought i would pass on to you.

as you know, genie are sponsoring our society and as such we can pass on to 
you a great offer regarding their pre-pay SIM card package. we will 
hopefully be selling these on the door of the web design lectures starting 
from the session on this thursday evening. this start date is still to be 
confirmed, but i will keep you informed.

Non-members : £4
Members: £3
Members attending lectures : £2

more information on the available package is attached at the bottom of this 
email. look for yourself at http://www.genie.co.uk

this weeks lecture is apparantly going to be much, much simpler than the 
material covered with frames and tables last week. so those of you who came 
last week expect an easier ride, those of you who missed this more 
specialised material can download it from http://www/e-cs.org and catch up.

we will be looking at:
(i)   Making 'hotspots' on images using Dreamweaver and Frontpage
(ii)  Choosing custom RGB colours in Frontpage and Photoshop
(iii) How to get your page on the web - using geocities
(iv)  Cool stuff using simple JavaScript

have fun people and i will keep you informed of any updates that come my 
way.

Ben

members

after last weeks rather important javascript introduction lecture this weeks 
course is going to be soooooooo much more exciting.

if you didnt make it to the course then you have missed an essential 
foundation to understanding javascript and should download the notes from 
the e-cs website asap, and get Ned to answer any of your problems with the 
material.

for the rest of us who did attend, now that we understand the basics we can 
move on to some much more interesting and functional content. with the hard 
stuff under our belts we will also find the rest of the material much easier 
to deal with.

so, everybody come along to elec eng rm 408 at 6:30 on tuesday or thursday, 
and i promise, it will be far less like REAL work than it was last week.

see you all at the lectures,

Ben

ned has asked if there is a demand for a repeat for some or all of the web 
design lectures that he gave last term.

i you would like him to cover something specific or just do the whole lot 
again, or, alternatively, you know somebody else who missed out on the 
opportunity then please reply to this email and let me know. these course 
will only run if there is a demand for it, so if you would like to come then 
you must let me know.

see you all soon

Ben

sorry about the late notice, tonight there IS a lecture in the usual place 
at the usual time. from now on: the tuesday session will be held by ned and 
he will delivering repeat lectures from last term. he will be covering his 
whole syllabus, so tonight, he starts from lecture 1. so if you missed some 
of his material, or didnt quite understand a particular aspect, then please 
come along as see the man himself.

the thursday session will be held by etienne, who, from now on, will be 
covering the NEW material. he will only be delivering 1 lecture per week and 
each week will be different material from the last. the material will 
supplement the material we learned last term from ned. this time, however, 
we will be looking at the real working of the system at a much 'lower 
level.' i will pass more information about what the syllabus for this term 
will cover to you as soon as i have it.

i hope you are all having a good new term, and i will see you all at the 
lectures.

Ben

hello members

this week our lectures REALLY ARE going to start, no more messing about, 
sorry about the confusion but it takes a little time to organise what is 
going to happen for the rest of the term so that it suits everybody.

Recap:

Tuesdays, 18:30, Elec Eng 408, "Beginners Web Page Design" with Ned Lowe 
(EEE2)
       this week - "Intoduction to html"

Thursdays, 18:30, Elec Eng 408 "Dynamic web applications" with Etienne 
Pollard (ISE3)

We hope that these courses will be even better supported than last term, so 
we look forward to seeing you all there.

Remember, these lectures are still just £1 on the door per lecture. There is 
NO joining fee.

Hello Members

Here is a quick update of what is going to be happening this week.

On Tuesday, Ned is continuing his course on Introduction to HTML.
On Thursday, THERE WILL BE NO LECTURE!!

This week: Ned will be covering:

	More simple tags
	Picture alignment
	Tables and how they can be used
	Frames
	Nested framesets (links)
	In-line frames
	Downloading

So come along if any of this material sounds like it might appeal to you.

Etienne resumes his course on Creating Dynamic Web Applications on 
Thursday 14th. His courses are aimed at a level of computer literacy of a 
person who has some experience in the field, or those who attended Neds 
lectures last term. His introductory lecture was last week, it was a quick 
run down of what the course will be covering this term. If you missed it, 
you have not missed any vital material. The notes are available from 
Etiennes personal webpage though:

http://www/doc.ic.ac.uk/~ejhp98/lectures/

His lectures this term will cover:
	Basic CGI scripting
	Basic Database Interfaces
	Choosing web server software

Next week, in particular, he will be looking at basic examples of:
	Traditional CGI scripting
	(Apache & Perl)
	Scripting within the web server
	(Apache & PHP modules)

I hope that this has cleared up some of the mystery of what is going on this 
term. We also have some guest lecturers scheduled near the end of the term, 
so keep your diaries free:

Rm 408  Elec Eng
Tuesdays / Thursdays
18:30 start. (Try to get there in time so the lectures can start promptly at 
18:30)

See you all soon, keep smiling

Ben Pritchard

Hello members

Here is this weeks newsletter.

There will be no lecture from Ned this week. His commitments to the EEsoc 
Revue mean that he cannot hold his lecture.

In its place, Etienne will be taking his lecture on the Tuesday so that it 
does not clash with Valentine's Day. This lecture is the start of Etienne's 
main material. His previous session served as mainly an introduction. It is 
not necessary to have attended this previous session if you wish to start 
his course this week.

So the timetable reads:

    Tuesday: Etienne: 'Dynamic Web Applications.'

    Thursday: No lecture

Have a good week.

Ben

i can only apologise about last weeks cancellation on thursday. etienne was 
ill and unable to deliver the lecture. a little apology from him is at the 
end of this message.

this week (i hope) should be business as usual. with ned on tuesday and 
etienne on thursday (in their normal slots).

i should also bring to your attention an important change to the schedule 
next week. on thursday 7th. etienne's lecture will be replaced by a talk 
from a guest speaker. we are very lucky yo have Paull Robathan the Managing 
Director of Carlton Research and visiting Fellow at the Imperial College 
Management School coming in to discuss the latest developments in 
e-business. more details will be made available nearer the time but i 
thought i would give you a little information now to get you all excited. we 
hope this event will be very well attended because he is an excellent 
speaker and extremely knowledgeable in his field.

lets hope that this week is able to run without any hitches. keep coming to 
the lectures. these courses are run for you, an opportunity to expand your 
circle of knowledge.

see you all at the lectures

Ben

****************************************************************

here is etiennes little piece that he sent me:

very sorry about last night's cancellation - I was in fact ill in bed
(you don't want the details!) and hence in no fit state to deliver a
lecture. however, the slides are all prepared and if the good people of
the internet society will allow me to deliver it next week, I hope to
see you all there. again, many apologies for the cancellation and the
late notice.

Hello Members

I hope you have all enjoyed this spring term. Our agenda has now finished. 
Both Ned and Etienne's courses have finished and will not restart next term. 
So please do not continue to arrive at: 408 Elec Eng on either evening 
because there will be nothing going on.

If you have any feedback about how we have served you this year then please 
feel free to reply to this email and let me know. How do you think we have 
run the two courses? What were they like? What did you think of the guest 
lecturer? What would you like us to do for you in the future?  We have over 
250 members at the moment and we want to do what is appealing to you, so 
please send me any ideas you have, however trivial they seem.

Have a good Easter, I hope all the revision goes ok and I will see you all 
in the summer term.

Ben
