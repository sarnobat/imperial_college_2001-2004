Dear Computing-1 and JMC-1 students,

There are four matters raised in this email - please read and absorb them
all carefully.

1. 1st year Home Page
---------------------

This page - http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~cjh/Iyc/year1Coord.html - is
frequently updated and is your primary source of information about what's
happening in your course. Please consult it regularly, especially to keep
up-to-date with your assessment schedules.

2. Continuous Assessment Tracking Engine (CATE)
-----------------------------------------------

This system, called CATE, has recently been implemented to enable tutors
and students to view the marks registered for your PMT/PPT submissions.
You can view your own personal record at any time by going to the main CATE
page - https://soroban.doc.ic.ac.uk/~cate/ - and following the appropriate
links and actions.
The main link just cited now appears on your 1st year Home Page.

3. Haskell Mini-test in Week 5
------------------------------

In Week 5 you have a mini-test counting as assessed coursework for your
course 120 Declarative Programming I. Comp1 students have already had a
similar mini-test in Week 3.
The Week 5 arrangements will be as follows:

	Comp1 	31 Oct 10.00 am in Room 343
	JMC1	02 Nov  3.00 pm in Room 145

4. Haskell Driving Test in Week 6
---------------------------------

In Week 6 you have a Driving Test, sat in the labs, which also counts as
assessed coursework for your course 120 Declarative Programming I.
The Week 6 arrangements will be as follows:

	Comp1 09 Nov 10.00-12.00
	JMC1  06 Nov 15.00-17.00

The Lab Coordinator will advise you about seating arrangements in the labs
and about any other practical issues.

The lecturers will advise you about the nature of the test and about
whatever materials you may bring with you.

The test begins with a phase of about 20 minutes for reading the question
paper and planning your programs, followed by a phase of 90 minutes for
implementing them.

Regards,
Chris.

As you are doing your Haskell Driving Test next week you will
not be doing a lab exercise next week.

The next lab exercise will run from 12.11.01 to 19.11.01 and
will be distributed on Friday 9.11.01 in the usual way.

For the Driving Test you should come to room 219 or 203 
at 10.00 on Friday 9.11.01.  The test will be distributed in the lab
and you will have 20 minutes to read the question and plan an answer
on paper.  You will then have 90 minutes to write and test your
solution.

You should not bring any materials with you when you do the test
but copies of the prelude will be available at the test.

Thanks,

Peter Cutler

Dear Computing-1 students,

The Departmental web pages showing your first-year regulations have, until
today, indicated that to pass the first year you needed, among other
things, to pass at least eight of your ten main examinations.

At the beginning of the term, when I gave my introductory talk to you, I
stated that you had to pass nine of them, since this was the common belief
among those responsible for formulating the pass requirements.

The Director of Studies has now confirmed that nine is indeed the correct
number, and the Departmental Webpage Coordinator has accordingly been asked
to amend the web pages.

Regards,
Chris.

Hi All,
Some of you have been asking me how much the first year is worth out of
the three or four years. Andonis has kindly searched around on the doc
website and found the two following links. Happy hunting!

Dear fellow student 

Many of you will have seen the article in FELIX reporting the arrival of the
electronic Lecturer Evaluation Questionnaire (LEQ) and this email is to
advise you that this is now a reality. From Monday 3 December until Sunday 9
December you will have an opportunity to provide constructive feedback to
your department on most of the lecturers who have delivered lecture courses
over the past term. The LEQ site is viewable only via the College network
and is currently supported on Internet Explorer version 4.x and above.  The
Netscape v4.x browser is also supported but due to problems with the
Netscape v6.x browser this is not supported.  The LEQ web site is available
at the following url:

http://www.leq.ic.ac.uk

Your Username and password (which has been randomly generated) for use with
the LEQ web site is shown below:

Username:	ss401

Password:	cq376189

Please take some time to check out the site and complete the electronic
survey forms. You have the chance to win a cash prize for participating.

Remember this is your opportunity to make your voice heard.

Kind regards

Sen Ganesh, President IC Union
David Francis, Deputy President (Education and Welfare)

Dear All

You may already be aware that the Registry have set up a system to
register Lecturer Evaluations on-line and your password to access the
system should already have been emailed to you.  Please can I ask that
you take a few minutes to register your assessments and email me with
any comments/experiences of the on-line system this year so that I can
pass these onto Registry so that they can make any necessary changes to
the system.

Many thanks for your help, it is much appreciated.

Best wishes
Katherine

Dear Computing-1 and JMC-1 students,

There are three matters raised in this email - please read and absorb them
all carefully. The third one is especially important.

1. Xmas Test in Week 11
-----------------------

This tests you on all Autumn Term computing courses except Haskell and Java.
It is sat ONLY by Comp-1 students.

(JMC-1 are expected to have a similar test on maths courses in January.)

It takes place in rooms 308+311 on Thursday December 13th, 10.00-12.00.
There will be 5 compulsory questions on the paper, one for each course,
carrying equal weight. The marks contribute to your coursework total.

Further details are set out on the page

- http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~cjh/Iyc/xmastest.html


2. Java Driving Test in Week 11
-------------------------------

This test will be similar to the Haskell one you have already taken.
It tests you on the Programming I [Java] course, and is sat by
both Comp-1 and JMC-1 students.

It takes place in the labs on Thursday December 13th, 14.00-16.00.
There will be about 20 minutes for reading/planning, then 90 minutes
for implementation. The marks contribute to your labwork total.

These details are also set out on the page

- http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~cjh/Iyc/drivingtest.html


3. Haskell Examination in 2002
------------------------------

This is the Haskell half of your formal examination on Declarative
Programming. The second half, on Prolog, is not sat until the Summer Term.
Declarative Programming is one of the 10 examinations you take in year 1,
of which you need to pass at least 8 - so it is IMPORTANT.
The passmark for each one is 30%.

It will be sat in the labs in much the same way as your Driving Tests. A
period of 30 minutes will be allowed for reading/planning, followed by 90
minutes for implementation. As this is a formal examination, additional
rules will apply to conduct during the sitting, of which you will be
advised in due course.

Provisionally, the anticipated date of the exam is Friday January 11th
2002, and the anticipated time is 11.00-13.00. A formal announcement will
soon be made which will either confirm or adjust these details.

Regards,
Chris.

The Advanced MSc students will have a Laboratory Exam on the 14th of December 2001
(last day of term) and require exclusive use of room 219 from 10:00 am until 1:00 pm on
that day (the first hour will be used for the set up of the machines, with view to start
the exam at 11:00 am).

Please take into consideration the unavailability of this room in the organisation of your

work for the coming week.  It will be appreciated if noise levels in the adjacent
corridors
are kept to a minimum during the exam period, for the benefit of the students sitting the
exam.

Regards,
    Silvana Zappacosta

To allow you time to prepare for the Kenya/Java driving test next
week there is no lab exercise next week.  You should arrange to
demonstrate your Owari program to your PPT at some time next week.

As you will not be doing a lab there will be no lab workshop
or scheduled lab sessions.

Good luck in the test,

Peter Cutler

The CS1 and JMC1 students will be doing a lab test next week
and we will need exclusive use of the following labs while they are
doing their lab test.

We will need to use rooms 202/206/219 on Thursday 13.12.01 between
13.30 and 16.30 for the CS1/JMC1 lab test.

Could you please organise your use of the labs so that you can avoid
using rooms 202/206/219 at the above times.

Thanks,

Peter Cutler

There is a change to the arrangements for the driving test.
Could you go to either room 203 or 219 at the start of the 
Driving Test.  We will not be using room 206.

Thanks,

Peter Cutler

If you are thinking of entering the Owari Programming
Competition for 2001 we have had confirmation from
O'Reilly books that they will be offering a prize of
100 pounds worth of O'Reilly computing books for the
winner of the competition.  This will be in addition
to the department's prize of 25 pounds.

Thanks,

Dear All

Chris Hogger (first year co-ordinator) has asked me to forward the mail
below.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Comp-1 students,

I am advised that the timetabled slots for Logic, Lab and Mathematical
Methods will not be used this Friday by the teaching staff concerned
with
them.

Therefore, provided you have no other obligations, you are free not to
attend College on Friday.

You may wish to note, however, that the (entirely voluntary) Owari
competition will be held on Friday, and that Haskell Driving Test resit
students have been required by Dr. Field to submit a Haskell program
before the end of Friday.

Regards,
Chris.

Hi everyone,

I've put together an alternative to Charlee's MSN community in my DoC
webspace for all you people who don't like giving your details to Mr
Gates. It also will only let in members of CS1 (without me having to
approve members) and it also identifies you automatically by name and
picture whenever you post. It doesn't let any staff in either :-)

Check it out at http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ncg01/cs1/

A brief summary of its features:

 * Forums for you to discuss what's going on in the year, and anything
else (within reason!)
 * Automatic identification of posters by their login, including name
and picture.
 * A page of links to all the various lecture notes and slides etc.
available on the web (thanks to Jamie Denton)
 * News headlines from the UK and around the world.
 * A 'now/next' bar showing where you should be now and where you should
be next.

The now/next bar isn't finished yet as I'm waiting for the final
timetable for next term to come out before I enter it into the database.

Feel free to use it! There may be a few bugs in it as I've been mostly
editing someone else's code so if you find any let me know.

Cheers,
Neil Greatorex

Just a quick reminder
 
For those of you who haven't picked up the brown envelopes with you
candidate number on it, go into the common room, where u get the lab
specs, opposite the windows there are brown pgeonholes with sets of
names on, yours will be on one of them (they're in alphabetical order).
you will find a brown envelope with your name on it, open it, you need
the candidate number for the exam.

The software labs for this term will start in week 4
of term (28.1.02).  This will allow you to learn sufficient
Java to do an introductory lab. 

There will however be a hardware lab in the first two teaching 
weeks of term (weeks 2 and 3).  This lab will be organised by 
Dave Adams, Derek Brough and Duncan Gillies and will not be 
marked or introduced by your PPTs.  

The hardware lecturers will give you further details about the
hardware lab in the lab workshop next week.

You will need to arrange your first PPT meeting for the week beginning
(28.1.02).  The first lab will be distributed on Friday 25.1.02.


Thanks,

Peter Cutler

There has been a change of venue for the CS1 lab 
workshop on Mondays at 14.00.  Originally it was 
held in room 311 but from now on it will now be held
in room 343.

Thanks,

Peter Cutler

You are due to meet your PPT for the first time this Thursday
(4.10.01) at 17.00 in their office.  You should have details about 
your PPT in your starter pack.  If you are uncertain about who your 
PPT is or where their office is I have put the details on the lab web
page at:

http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/lab/cs1

(follow the links "PPT Room" - to find out your ppt's room 
and "CS1 PPT List" - to find out who your PPT is)

If your PPT has emailed you directly with details about the
first PPT meeting then this information takes priority over the
information given on the lab web page.

Most of the PPT's rooms are in the Huxley building but some are in the
William Penney Lab and this is found on the left hand side of the
walkway opposite the Junior Common Room.

I will put a paper copy of this information on the CS1 notice 
board outside the Student General Office (room 345).

You should now have the first two lab exercises.  Please note that the
first lab exercise should be submitted before the end of Monday 8.10.01.
You can submit your program as many times as you want. Each submission
overwrites any previous submissions.  It is the last submission that is
autotested and sent to your PPT.

Thanks,

Peter Cutler

I have put a copy of the spec for the next assessed lab
"Haskell LSystems" in the lab tray in the Student Common Room 
(room 342).  The Student Common Room can be found on at the 
end of the corridor with the noticeboards which runs between 
rooms 340 and 343 in the Huxley building.

The tray with the specs can be found at the far end of the
bank of trays on the wall to the left of the windows as you 
go into the main part of the Student Common Room.  The tray 
is labelled "CS1 Lab Spec".  

As a rule we will put the lab spec in the tray each Friday
for you to collect.

Please note that the official issue date for the lab is Monday
of next week and we have let you have the lab early so that you
can look at the next lab over the weekend (whilst you are
completing the previous lab).

Thanks,

Peter Cutler

Hi,
            Today was the termly Staff Student Committee meeting, and
one issue that was raised that is relevant to both JMC 1 annd CS 1.
There was a general consensus that the Programming II lectures had
missed out on the basics of java and gone straight onto the advanced
inheritance.  
 
So, if there is enough demand, I have a 4th year who is willing to do
some lectures on the basics of java, basic classes and syntax for anyone
who needs it or is having trouble with the basic.
 
            Can anyone who feels they would attend please e-mail me so I
can get an idea of how many people would like this.  Please include any
specific requests in the e-mails of what you are having difficulties
with.
 
Thanks
 
Jamie (CS-1 rep)

Sorry to mail u again, but I thought it would be better to send this
separately to just cs-1.
 
Ok, as you know the SSC meeting was today and several issues were raised
relevant to us.
 
1.	Java lectures - see  my other mail
2.	S.Luzzato replacing vector algebra with dynamic systems -
S.Eisenbach agreed to help organize extra lectures to cover this topic
as it can be on the exam.  Me and Pili will speak to her tomorrow to try
get dates fixed.
3.	VRML - S.Eisenbach agreed task was too hard, I am trying to
either get proper lectures on it if anyone in the department knows it
well enough, or and additional extension or a change to the assignment
to simplify it.
4.	Labs - S.Eisenbach has already spoken to Dr Russo to ensure
future labs are more closely related to teaching.
5.	S.Eisenbach expressed concern over lack of attendance at
lectures in general and especially tutorials.  Come on people, if you're
not attending lectures don't be surprised if the course is hard.  
 
There were other items but I think those are the main ones.
 
Below are the minutes for last terms meeting (which I only got recently
myself).

Dear All 
Apologies for the delay in getting these minutes to you.

Department of Computing 
Staff-Student Committee Meeting 
12 November 2001 
Present: A Arya, D Livesley, S Ohrie, H Grunditz, NA Danielsson, S
Vertsetis, K Bhatia, R Jon, C Toffis, J Scotney, M Bader, F Oyeyinka, M
Pilar, J Denton, R Parathyras, J Ashcroft-Leigh, C Tripp, I Angus, J
Fisher, N Malik, M Guerra Arias, S Eisenbach, J Kramer, M Cunningham, K
Clark, W Luk, F Sadri, K Pigott. 
  
4.2 Matters Arising from the minutes 
SE told the committee that she had told Academic Committee of the
students' recommendation for increased tutorials. 
JK wished to address the staff-student committee before student reports
commenced.  He told the committee that the departmental R.A.E. had
passed off well.  He wished to raise the issue of the increasing problem
of space in the department (mainly as a result of increased successful
recruiting of RAs and securing of additional grants).  He told the
committee that the space issue had been looked at and the department was
developing a strategy for revamping the department's rooms. The first
step was having building work done on 308, which would take 308 and 311
out of action for the summer months.  He added that there were plans to
convert 342, currently a space for student lockers and pigeon holes.  He
was currently in negotiations with Maths to discuss the possible
outcomes of this conversion.  The advantage of this conversion would be
less cramped lecture theatres.  JK told the committee that the student
reps should treat this news as a formal early warning, and as soon as he
had a time frame for the changes to 342 he would let the committee know.
He asked the departmental rep to disseminate this information to his
student colleagues. 
Action:  AA 
Computing Year 4 (IA, JF) 
IA said that there was a problem with applications for resources for
individual projects.  SE said that a number of students asking for
inappropriate resources had been turned down and SE asked that the
students resubmit more realistic resource applications. 
IA also wished to register a complaint about the teaching for Natural
Language Processing.  SE stated that the best course of action would be
to speak to the lecturer concerned directly. 
Action IA, JF 
Computing Year 3 (MB) 
It was reported that some third year MEng students were unhappy with
their timetables, especially those students which had chosen a
humanities option, they felt that the exams timetable was excessively
cramped.  SE asked the student reps to bring her the number of students
with the timetable problems and she would see what she could do.  She
said that if the cramped timetable affected several students she would
be able to shuffle the timetable somewhat, this would not be the case if
only one or two students were involved.  In the latter case shuffling
the dates of tests could result in inconveniencing more students than it
helped. 
Action MB, NM, SE 
Computing Year 2 (CT, JAL) 
CT told the committee, that apart from the heavy course-work load the
second year was fine. 
Computing Year 1 (JD, MGA) 
JD complained that the lecturer for 145 - Mathematical Methods and
Graphics had been unprepared.  SE stated that she had spoken to the
lecturer concerned and had understood from the first year students that
the lecturer had improved.  JD acknowledged that the lecturer had
improved somewhat but that there was still room for further improvement.
He also stated that one of the lecturers in discrete maths had problems
with her lecturing style.  SE suggested in both cases that the students
approached the lecturer directly. 
Action JD, MA 
JMC4 (KB) 
KB told the committee that although coursework submission sheets were
now on the web, the task of printing them out was proving very
frustrating to students.  JF wondered if the department could go back to
their old system of AKR printing out the sheets and placing them in the
student common room.  JK informed the committee that this printing
difficulty was part of a wider printing problem and that the department
was currently reviewing the printer situation.  JF then asked if there
could be some notice posted on and around the photocopiers printers
instructing students in appropriate printing protocol/etiquette.  He
felt that this would be particularly useful for first year students and
could include instructions on how to clear paper jams etc.  AA informed
the committee that he had several discussions with CSG and that this was
one of the proposals that they were prepared to instigate. 
Action AA, CSG 
JMC3 (RJ and CT) 
RJ felt that JMC students were not adequately informed about the Maths
projects available to them, most students ended up taking computing
projects as a result.  SE answered in response to a direct question that
year co-ordinators and MSc co-ordinators were responsible for putting
course-work deadlines on the web. 
JMC2 (DL) 
DL felt that JMC suffered clustered deadlines as there did not seem to
be co-ordination of these deadlines between maths and computing.  SE
stated that Computing had tried to spread out the deadlines.  KLC
suggested an alternative strategy would be to look at the handout dates.

JMC1 (FO) 
FO told the committee that he had been in frequent contact with MRC and
so most problems had been sorted out at this stage in the term.  SE told
the committee that as a consequence of changes to JMC regulations passed
by the department last year, the current JMC1 was less strenuous this
year. 
ISE Departmental Reps (HG, SO) 
They told the committee some ISE4  students were finding it difficult to
submit resources requests by the deadline as not all students had had
their project choices approved/finalised. 
MSc Conversion (JS, RP) 
The MSc Conversion students were fine. 
MSc Advanced Computing (SV, ND) 
Both the Reps felt that some of the courses were difficult to follow.
SE suggested that they speak to the lecturers directly. 
Action SV, ND 
Computing Dep Rep 
AA felt that there were not enough lockers and felt that some of them
were being used by non-computing students.  JK said that he was looking
into this matter.  AA also said that non-computing students were using
computing printers.  JK said that AA should talk to CSG about enhancing
security to ensure that this did not happen.   AA also wanted to take
action to prevent students leaving their machines locked for the whole
day whilst they were elsewhere. SE suggested that if AA wanted CSG to
instigate an autotimeout facility that he should meet with them to
discuss the possibilities. 
SE asked the committee to report broken machines as and when they find
them, this would prevent the pile up of broken machines in the labs. 
AA also asked if anything could be done about the slow printing time of
the examination papers currently on the web.  He said that many students
had complained that they were unable to print the papers they needed due
to a huge printer queue backlog.  He suggested that the SAO could sell
photocopies of the papers for a nominal fee (this is what they currently
do in the maths department).  SE said that she would look into the
feasibility of the SAO printing the papers. 
AA mentioned the upcoming electronic LEQs devised by Registry.  He asked
if the forms were still the lengthy ones offered at the last attempt.
JK suggested that they did not need to fill in all the boxes - just the
most relevant information for each course. AA said that there would need
to be feedback of the results if the operation was a success.  There
then followed a brief discussion where the possibility  of offering
departmental prizes for votes was discussed.  It was agreed that the
reps would need to exert peer pressure on their fellow students in order
to get high numbers of students to vote. 
At the end of the meeting JK asked the Reps to pass on the message that
students were to stop dismantling the lab chairs.  The Reps agreed to
pass this message on. 
Action SE, AA, CSG

 Hi everyone!
 
 This message is mainly addressed to people who have their computer on the
network.

About  24 hours ago only, I started sharing some documents on the
network(until there, nothing special). In this really very short lapse of
time somebody managed to put a virus on my computer- the well known W32
nimda-
So I would advise the few people who  visited the computer called Tempest on
Monday evening to scan their hard-drive for viruses. 
Apparently some people still ignore what a anti-virus software is and it is
pretty annoying and appalling since it is very easy to find this type of
software within the network or the Internet.

Cheers

Julien

My records show that you have been awarded 3 points for the match against
Mech Eng 2. I also have an email from Materials stating that you failed to
turn up to their match. Hence you won one match and lost one.

Dear Comp-1 students,

For those of you taking the Topics option (rather than Foreign Language), I
need soon to have you arranged in groups of 3 in readiness for next term's
work.

Each of you may or may not wish to indicate who you'd prefer to work with.

If you have any preference to work with one or two others, then one of that
group should inform me by email - giving the DoC logins of the others - no
later than

	Friday March 8th  [hard deadline]

After that date, I will randomly group any still-single persons.

Once the groups are fully determined, I will then prescribe which group
takes which topic - this is not something you can influence yourselves.

Regards,
Chris.

The Kenya/Java driving test resit will take place on
Friday 8th March 2002 in room 202 at 16.00.  The test
will be run using the same rules as the previous 
Kenya/Java driving test. Details of the rules can be 
read at:

As a result of a typo, the first and second SQL queries are the
same in the spec.  The first query in fact should be:

1) Show the film titles and directors of all films, sorted
by director (1 mark).

We have asked CSG to set up database accounts that will allow you
to experiment with the psql system.  Unlike the films database
that you will be using for your lab, you will be able to create
and change tables in your own database account.

To log in to your database account type:

	psql YOUR_LOGIN 

where YOUR_LOGIN is replaced by your actual login (abc101 or whatever).
You will not need to type in a password.

If you have been logged on to the system for some time you may
have to authenticate your password by using the command:

	kinit

Please note this account is provided for your interest just 
in case you would like to change a psql database as mentioned
in the unassessed part of the exercise.  It is not needed for
the assessed part of the exercise.

Thanks,

Peter Cutler

Dear Computing-1 students,

Some of you have not yet given me your preferences about grouping for the
Topics course. Since, as you know, I am a very soft-hearted person, I will
extend my "hard" deadline of Friday March 8th to a "super-hard" deadline of
Tuesday March 12th, and after that I really will have to decide the
remaining groupings myself.

Regards,
Chris.

Dear Computing-1 students,

On your 1st-year web noticeboard I have put a link

http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~cjh/Iyc/javaexam.html

to a page giving details of your forthcoming Java Exam on March 25th.

Please read and absorb it carefully, as this is one of your 10 main
examinations.

Regards,
Chris.

Thanks to everyone who has contacted us re: testing out Kenya, we intend
to start letting people have a play monday next week.  A couple of
people have raised particular issues and suggestions & are about to be
replied to personally.  It would be really great if the worthy people
who have volunteered could give us a time to find them in labs, or even email
us
on the day to set it up for them.  Any other willing volunteers are
welcome.....

Thanks again folks,

Chris Gale

If you did not get a copy of the current lab from
the "Reasoning about Programming" class on Friday
you can collect the spec at the lab workshop today at
14.00. 

Alternately you can collect one from our office 
(room 372).

Thanks,

Peter Cutler

My thanks to those who emailed me to say that the data was unavailable. 
It is back again now (we temporarily lost contact with another
database).

Dear Sridhar,

The only dead link I found on the page was that pointing at the schedule
(which has been fixed), but under that you should find an entry pointing
at http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~pjm/db-int-lecture-notes.ps

The first year computer students will be sitting a programming
exam in the labs on the morning of Monday 25/03/02. The students 
will work under exam conditions and require complete silence for
the duration of the exam. 

For this reason the first year computing students will need exclusive 
use of the labs 202 and 219 on level 2 until 1.30 pm on Monday.

For this reason could you please organise your time so that you can
avoid using the labs at the above times.

Thanks,

Peter Cutler

Dear Computing-1 students,

I have a few points to mention:

1. You will, of course, know you have a Java exam on Monday:

    http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~cjh/Iyc/javaexam.html

   Arrive at the labs by 11.00. Bring your swipe card.

2. I have assigned Topics subjects to Topics groups - see this page:

    http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~cjh/Iyc/topics_groups.html

3. I have given a sketch of the Summer-term work - see this page:

    http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~cjh/Iyc/summerterm.html

   from which you will see that Topics and Prolog have to be completed
   in parallel during Weeks 4-6. You were to have had a mighty graphics
   project to do at the same time as all this but I managed to get that
   scrapped, otherwise you'd all have gone mad.

   Regarding Topics, I would encourage you to keep in contact with your
   group-colleagues during the vacation and perhaps do some preliminary
   reading and planning on your assigned subject.

Regards,
Chris.

Dear All,

Please note the College exam instructions telling students they must
have their swipe card with them in all exams.

The Department would like students to display the cards on their desks
during the exams.

Please also bring with you your candidate number, which you need to
state on all your exam scripts. Your candidate number should have been
attached, as a label, to the timetable sent to you by Registry.

Best wishes

Dear All,

I've just checked with Registry who tell me that timetables (plus
candidate numbers) were sent to all undergraduate students in Computing
to their pigeon holes (letter racks in 345) on March 25.

If you have not collected your letter as yet, if at all possible, please
could you collect it from the letter racks in 345 tomorrow, Friday, 19
April between 9am and 5pm. If you are not back in time to do this
tomorrow, anyone sitting the first exam on Monday, could you please
collect your letter between 9 and 9:30am on Monday morning. Anyone not
sitting exams on the first morning, could you please collect your letter
later on in the morning (after 11am).

Best wishes
Teresa

Dear All,

As you know, as soon as your exams have finished you have two more main
tasks, namely Topics and Prolog. They are undertaken roughly in parallel. A
summary of the term's schedule is given on the page:

http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~cjh/Iyc/summerwork.html

Note that, in association with Topics, you have a lecture about the web
timetabled at 9.00 am next Wednesday (May 15th).

The Topics work is undertaken wholly on your own initiative, and so you
should soon look closely at the page describing it:

http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~cjh/Iyc/topics.html

Although most of the afternoons next week (Week 4) are consumed by the
Prolog course, you should make use of the mornings in that week for your
Topics work. Meet early on with the other members of your Topics group to
begin planning your website and the division of responsibilities. The
composition of the groups is set out on the page:

http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~cjh/Iyc/topics_groups.html

In each of Weeks 5 and 6 there will be an "open surgery" slot in which you
can visit the tutor(s) responsible for your particular topic in order to
discuss your work. The tutor(s) should advise you of this arrangement in
due course. Their contact details are as follows:

	Topic: Medical Computing
	Lecturer: dr (Daniel Rueckert)
	TA: apgs (Gabrielle Sinnadurai)

Regards,
Chris.

Dear All,

If you have collected all your assessed assignments, you may resubmit 
your bundle of courseworks before the end of term - 21st June. 
 Numerical order = as it appears on your Candidate Personal Page, so the 
examiners can easily access any coursework, as necessary, from the bundle.  

Please ignore this message, if you are an MEng 3 student who has already 
resubmitted your courseworks.

The Examiners' meeting will take place from June 25th to 28th June.  You 
may collect your  bundles of courseworks from the first week of July.

Thank you for your cooperation.


Angela.

Dear UGsand PGs,

As in past years, you are required to resubmit all assessed 
Lab/Courseworks to Room 345 for the Examiners' meeting in June.  Please 
ensure that you have collected all your marked work as soon as possible.  

Please printout your student page with the grades with all your assessed 
submissions and put this page at the front/top of your coursework 
bundle.  You may collect string and labels from Room 345  so that you 
can tie up your courseworks in a neat bundle.  Please arrange your 
courseworks in mumerical order.

JMC students, please resubmit courseworks for Computing Courses NOT 
Maths courses.

Label as follows:

Name::
JMC Year:(1,2,3,4)
DoC Year:(1,2,3,4, MSc or Mac.)
Tutor/Supervisor:

If you need any additional help, please let me know a s a p.

Regards,


Angela.

Next Wednesday (5/6/02) there will be a lab exam for
the CS1 students.  They will need exclusive use of rooms
219 and 202 in the morning until 1.30 pm.  They will be 
working under exam conditions which means that we will need 
complete quiet in the lab area for the duration of the exam.

Apart from the above, JMC1 students will be using room 206 from
10.00 am to 1.00 pm for a Maple lab.  

As 219/202/206 are being used during the morning on Wednesday it 
would be best if you could organise your time to avoid using the 
labs until after the exam has finished. 

Thanks,

Peter Cutler
