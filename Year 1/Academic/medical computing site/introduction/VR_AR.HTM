        <h2>Virtual Reality (VR)</h2>
        <h3>What it is</h3>
        <p>VR, quite simply, is the simulation of a 3D environment on a 2D
        display. In medical applications, one strives to simulate the 3D
        structure of various parts of the human body on a 2D display, be that an
        HMD, monitors viewed with red-blue glasses, or Binocular Omni
        Orientational Monitors.</p>
        <h3>Acuiring data</h3>
        <p>The structural data is obtained from CT, MRI and other scanning
        devices. The different data from each (i.e. bone structure from CT, soft
        tissue structure from MRI) can be superimposed to convey the information
        exhibited by both. Furthermore, several (i.e. hundreds) of layers of
        these 2D images can be stacked on top of each other to give a 3D
        structure with the information from all scan types using image rendering
        software such as <a href="http://www.ablesw.com/3d-doctor/volume.html">3D-Doctor</a>.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="../non-published%20files/public_html/introdution/scans.jpg"></p>
        <p align="center"><img src="../non-published%20files/public_html/introdution/model.jpg"></p>
        <h3>Rendering Performance</h3>
        <p>Traversal of a 3D structure, whose data file takes up 100’s of
        Mbytes, is computationally very demanding. The whole data set is being
        rendered when significant portions of it are invisible to the viewer
        (e.g. a brain behind the skull). This type of rendering is called Volume
        Rendering. In many cases the performance can be improved by using
        Surface Rendering where only the visible surfaces are processed.
        However, even this isn’t ideal as determining the visible surfaces is
        itself a computationally costly procedure.</p>
        <p>Either way, huge numbers of polygons will be generated and the CPU is
        working overtime to process them. Graphics hardware similar to that used
        in computer games takes the burden off the CPU increasing performance,
        as well as improving image quality.</p>
        <p>It may be necessary to assign planes to particular organs where
        behaviour simulation is key. The viewer may wish to move one organ
        independently from the others, render them invisible to avoid obscuring
        other structures (as in this <a href="video.mpeg">video</a>), or see how they change shape when
        applying pressure. Plastic surgery benefits from this capability.</p>
        <h2>Augmented Reality (AR)</h2>
        <h3>What it is</h3>
        <p>AR essentially attempts to manipulate the best features of both
        virtual reality and the real world itself: the low cost associated with
        Virtual Reality compared to the construction and use of a real world
        equivalent; and the appeal of the real world to the user’s perception
        of a scene.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="../non-published%20files/public_html/introdution/analogy.jpg"></p>
        <p>The computer-generated objects can be viewed on a PC or, better
        still, with and HMD which views the real objects too. In fact, Augmented
        Reality is closer to the real world because it is predominantly made up
        of real world objects; computer generated objects feature much more
        sparsely (Augmented Virtuality would be closer to VR than the real
        world).</p>
        <h3>Where it’s used</h3>
        <p>A simple, albeit not completely genuine example of AR in use is the
        weather forecast. The reporter stands in front of a blank blue screen
        but to those viewing it on TV, it appears as though the reporter is
        standing in front of a map. This isn’t a pure example because there is
        no interaction between the real and virtual objects.</p>
        <p>In medicine, AR can have a wide range of uses particularly in
        surgery. Conventionally, surgeons operate on a patient while frequently
        consulting 2D CT or MRI images. Aside from the limits of 2D images, the
        surgeon would have to look back and forth during the procedure. AR
        allows the surgeon to see everything in one view.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="../non-published%20files/public_html/introdution/brain.jpg"></p>
        <p>Thus, it would be easier to detect tumours, cysts or abnormal blood
        vessels, and even ‘see’ the surgical instruments and surgeon’s own
        hands buried in the patient’s body. It is as if the irrelevant parts
        of the patient’s body are invisible.</p>
        <p>AR can also be useful for practicing plastic surgery where a skull
        model changes shape according to actions by a surgeon wearing datagloves
        (i.e. gloves with attached sensors that monitor the hand movements).</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="../non-published%20files/public_html/introdution/skull.jpg"></p>
        <p>Indeed, many more operations can be practised with the aid of AR, so
        that the surgeon is more confident and experienced when a real patient’s
        well-being is at stake.
