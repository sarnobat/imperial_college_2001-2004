        <h2>World's First Full Telesurgery a Success (Business2.com)</h2>
        </a><font color="blue">
        <p>Somehow &quot;Operation Lindburgh&quot; just doesn't sound
        revolutionary enough. Not when you consider the kind of advancement
        achieved by Professor Jacques Marescaux and his 40-person team from the
        Institute for Research into Cancer of the Digestive System (IRCAD).
        Working from New York on September 7, Marescaux removed the gallbladder
        from a 68-year-old woman in Stroudsburg, France. It was the first major,
        trans-Atlantic telesurgical operation ever to be completed. The patient
        suffered no complications and returned home two days later.</p>
        <p>The combination of robot, video and telecommunication technologies
        will make it possible for surgeons to perform operations on patients
        anywhere on the planet. Applied, telesurgery may make it possible to
        allow specialists to aid surgeons in war zones or train doctors in
        developing countries. Said Marescaux, &quot;It lays the foundations for
        the globalisation of surgical procedures, making it possible to imagine
        that a surgeon could perform an operation on a patient anywhere in the
        world.&quot;</p>
        <p>In New York Marescaux's team, using a video screen and controllers
        connected with high-speed fibre-optic line, directed the arms of a Zeus
        laparoscopic surgical robot in an operating room 4,300 miles away.
        Doctors at the European Institute of Telesurgery in Stasbourg watched on
        during the 54-minute operation, ready to step in should a problem arise.</p>
        <p>As the robot was manipulated, the surgeon watched the machine's
        responses to his hand motions on a video screen. The time delay between
        his movements in NY, action in France and the visualization of that
        movement on the NY screen was only 155 milliseconds, virtually
        imperceptible to the human eye. That tiny time delay was the key to the
        success of the procedure. Experiments on pigs showed that a delay of
        more than 330 milliseconds would be too risky to the patient.</p>
        <p>France Telecom made the high-speed connection possible. The optimized
        compression developed by the company allowed video coding and decoding
        to be lightning fast. Combined with quick signal transmission,
        researchers were able to provide an even smaller delay than required.
        &quot;This was a tremendously challenging project, since we had to apply
        our expertise in high-speed services within an extremely exacting
        environment in terms of the reliability and security needed,&quot; said
        Jean-Pierre Temime, Director of Marketing for France Telecom Enterprise
        Services.</p>
        <p>Of course, the connection wasn't the only innovation. A special
        laparoscopic robot and complex software were developed by the
        engineering staff at Computer Motion, a high-tech company that develops
        medical equipment. They hope the new SocratesTM Tellecollaborative
        System, and MicrowristTM Technology for the ZeusTM Surgical Robotic
        System will usher in a time of increased &quot;tele-enabled surgery and
        real-time collaboration.&quot; &quot;We have taken an enormous step… [I]t's
        a good beginning to a new era,&quot; said Dr. Maky Zanganeh, Chairman
        and Chief Operating Officer for Computer Motion in Europe.</p>
        <p>All told, the operation cost $1 million. The experiment was described
        in Nature.</p>
        <p>&quot;It's a phenomenal step and we can't even begin to imagine the
        implications for medicine… the barriers of space and distance have
        collapsed,&quot; explained Marescaux.</p>

        <h2>Surgeons pioneer 'hands free' technology (BBC news)</h2>
        </a>
        <p>The new techniques could revolutionise operating theatres</p>
        <p>Pioneering surgery using computer equipment operated by voice
        commands is being performed for the first time in Britain.</p>
        <p>Surgeons using the system can alter lighting, apply suction, cut
        tendons and slice tissue by issuing instructions through a headset. BBC
        News' Navdip Dhariwal reports on the operating theatre of the future</p>
        <p>A computer using voice recognition feeds the commands to remote
        controlled keyhole surgical instruments.</p>
        <p>The system, developed in the United States, is being used for the
        first time in the UK on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Orthopaedic surgeons Neil Thomas and John Britton will demonstrate
        the technology in a series of shoulder and knee operations at North
        Hampshire Hospital, Basingstoke.</p>
        <p>Hermes could free up nurses for other work</p>
        <p>The system, called Hermes, was developed by the Californian medical
        equipment company Stryker Corporation.</p>
        <p>It can be used for many types of surgery, ranging from
        straightforward joint operations to complex heart bypasses and nerve
        repairs.</p>
        <p>The technology is said to reduce tissue damage and cut the time taken
        to complete most operations by up to 15%.</p>
        <p>In the US, 300 operating theatres built around Hermes have been
        established, with voice activation used for every piece of equipment,
        including telephones, operating tables and printers.</p>
        <p>The British version of Hermes is confined to voice-operated lighting
        and video, but will include surgical instruments by Christmas.</p>
        <p>Mr Neil Thomas is using the new equipment</p>
        <p>Surgeons, who watch a digital-quality video of the procedure on a
        monitor screen, guide instruments into position while speaking commands
        via a computer programmed to recognise his voice alone.</p>
        <p>Mr Thomas said: &quot;Whilst operating I wear a headset which
        connects me to the computer.</p>
        <p>&quot;This is voice sensitive and allows my voice to activate the
        surgical instruments such as the light, camera and image capture during
        the operation. The view of the joint during the operation is extremely
        clear.</p>
        <p>&quot;Hermes allows superb opportunities for teaching orthopaedic
        surgeons and we hope in the near future to be linked for videolink
        operating conferences.&quot;</p>
        <p>Voice commands must be spoken correctly. To increase illumination of
        the operating site the surgeon utters the words: &quot;Hermes, lights
        up&quot;.</p>
        <p>Similar commands operate precision cutting and filing tools, such as
        &quot;Hermes, shaver, oscillate&quot;.</p>
        <p>Chris Symonds, UK marketing manager for Stryker Corporation, said:
        &quot;Currently if a surgeon wants, for instance, to adjust the lighting
        he has to ask an assistant to do it, or stop what he is doing to alter
        it himself. With this system he simply speaks and Hermes responds.</p>
        <p>&quot;It's absolutely reliable. We wouldn't be allowed to bring a
        product like this to market unless it was fully approved and tested.
        It's not voice recognition like you might have on your computer.</p>
        <p>&quot;Hermes only responds to 100 commands, listening to every sound
        and filtering out what it wants to hear. It's very sophisticated.&quot;</p>
        <p>He said the equipment at Basingstoke cost around £47,000. A full
        system would be considerably more, but would lead to long term savings.</p>

        <h2>Spinal Surgery (BBC news)</h2>
        </a>
        <p>Scientists are developing a robot that can reduce the risks
        associated with extremely delicate surgery on the spine.</p>
        <p>The robot is capable of operating to the nearest tenth of a
        millimetre.</p>
        <p>Operations on the spinal column are particularly delicate - one false
        movement of the scalpel can lead to paralysis.</p>
        <p>However, surgery is often the only way to relieve patients of pain
        after a slipped disc, tumour removal or damage to vertebrae.</p>
        <p>To reduce the risks involved, researchers at the four Fraunhofer
        Institutes in Germany are developing a surgical robot.</p>
        <p>The robot's movements are steadier than the hand of the surgeon and
        more precise.</p>
        <p>It is capable of inserting screws into the vertebrae to an accuracy
        of a tenth of a millimetre.</p>
        <p>These screws are then used to attach rigid bars to the vertebrae in
        order to stabilise the spinal column.</p>
        <p>To avoid injury, and ensure that the screws are inserted as precisely
        as possible, doctors have been using X-ray images to monitor such
        operations.</p>
        <p>The disadvantage of this method is that X-ray pictures can only be
        taken at intervals of several minutes.</p>
        <p>The robot can insert screws into the vertebrae</p>
        <p>As a result, despite taking the utmost care, there are frequent cases
        of injury to the bone marrow, adjacent nerves or major blood vessels.</p>
        <p>Dr Peter Weber, of the Fraunhofer Institute for Biomedical
        Engineering (IBMT), said: &quot;Until now, there was no way to monitor
        the insertion of the screws in real time.&quot;</p>
        <p>Researchers have tackled the problem by linking the robot to a
        navigation system using ultrasound.</p>
        <p>This allows the robot to monitor the insertion of the screws by
        taking ultrasound measurements.</p>
        <p>Simultaneously, all relevant information is displayed to the surgeon
        on a console, allowing him or her to intervene in the operation at any
        time.</p>
        <p>The surgical robot will go through its paces on dummy patients,
        before being employed for real-life operations on the lumbar region.</p>
        <p>Dr Weber hopes that the robots will be capable of performing
        operations on the cervical vertebrae in the neck - some of which are
        currently impossible.</p>
        <p>He said: &quot;The vertebral structures are particularly fine here,
        and the risk of injury correspondingly high. The robot system could be a
        great help in this very sensitive region.&quot;</p>
        <p>Dr Patrick Kluger, a spinal injury expert who works at Stoke
        Mandeville Hospital, said the robot was one of several techniques
        currently being developed.</p>
        <p>These included the use of infra-red and magnetism as well as
        ultrasound. In fact, Dr Kluger has successfully carried out experimental
        surgery on the neck vertebrae using infra-red guidance.</p>
        <p>However, Dr Kluger said it was now possible to carry out a wide range
        of interventions using modern surgical techniques without the need for
        robots.</p>
        <p>He said: &quot;Surgery on the vertebral column is still especially
        demanding and risky, and needs special experience and training.</p>
        <p>&quot;But at the moment there is still no evidence at all that the
        use of computer navigation and robots increases the capacity, ability or
        security of surgery.&quot;</p>

        <br>
        By Pamela Ferdinand<br>
        Special to The Washington Post<br>
        Wednesday, November 18, 1998<br>
        <br>
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
        <br>
        BOSTON, Nov. 17, 1998<br>
        </font>
        <p>The e-mail arrived from halfway around the world: A Russian sailor,
        alone aboard his competition yacht bobbing in the stormy South Atlantic,
        two scalpels and used gauze scattered about the cabin, wondered if he
        would die.</p>
        <p>&quot;Have been sitting on the bloody cabin floor almost completely
        naked . . . watching as my life drop by drop leave me,&quot; Victor
        Yazykov typed on his keyboard last Thursday.</p>
        <p>Yazykov, a former Russian commando and now a solo sailor, had sailed
        two months earlier out of Charleston, S.C., in one of the world's most
        difficult sailing tests, and was still 400 miles from Cape Town, his
        next port of call. His elbow had become infected and he had been forced
        to perform makeshift surgery on himself, winding a tight tourniquet
        around his arm. But the bleeding wouldn't stop.</p>
        <p>At his office here at the New England Medical Center, physician
        Daniel Carlin knew something was going terribly wrong. Since the
        previous Tuesday, Carlin had been communicating with Yazykov by
        satellite e-mail about his injury and how to treat it. He had sent
        Yazykov step-by-step instructions on how to slice into his elbow and
        drain a life-threatening abscess. But clearly the sailor had forgotten
        to tell him some key piece of information.</p>
        <p>&quot;The stakes were very high,&quot; Carlin recalled in a telephone
        interview today. &quot;He was in an ocean with a lot of wind and waves.
        Losing his arm would have been a disaster.&quot;</p>
        <p>In the end, Carlin was able to instruct his distant patient on how to
        stop his bleeding, and Yazykov -- still competing in the ambitious solo
        race -- arrived safely in Cape Town on the tip of South Africa on
        Monday, ahead of four of his competitors and happy to be alive. Yazykov
        and Carlin spoke for the first time this morning by telephone, patched
        together by South African radio reporting on the remarkable
        long-distance surgery.</p>
        <p>It was an experience unlike any other for Carlin, a 39-year-old
        emergency specialist who founded World Clinic Inc. to provide
        at-a-distance health care through modern telecommunications. Usually his
        firm's clients call for something like a pharmacy in Portugal that
        carries yeast infection medication, he said.</p>
        <p>This was different.</p>
        <p>Electronic correspondence flew back and forth for days between
        Carlin, typing from the shelter of his medical office, and Yazykov,
        responding through an emergency solar-powered satellite communication
        system in a turbulent vessel northwest of Cape Town with no land in
        sight. The Russian could type only by day, and then just a paragraph at
        a time once an hour on an English keyboard, said Carlin, who spent
        sleepless nights worrying about his patient.</p>
        <p>The series of e-mail messages, reported here without Yazykov's
        spelling errors, tells the story of a dramatic rescue at sea.</p>
        <p>The messages began Nov. 10 as Yazykov approached the end of the first
        leg of the Around Alone Race. Carlin was the sailors' &quot;on
        call&quot; physician.</p>
        <p>&quot;My right elbow does not look good. Some yellow spot in the
        middle of red, and it feels like dead,&quot; Yazykov typed. Ominously,
        he added, &quot;Waiting for your help.&quot;</p>
        <p>Carlin messaged back that it could be an infection, but that he
        needed more information.</p>
        <p>&quot;All skin is glossy and shiny white,&quot; Yazykov wrote the
        next morning when his communications system could again transmit.
        &quot;It is like a pillow with some liquid inside.&quot;</p>
        <p>He said he was not in pain. But the description gave Carlin cause for
        alarm.</p>
        <p>Yazykov had injured his elbow at the beginning of the race but,
        despite the worsening symptoms, he remained calm and rational. Perhaps
        because he did not realize that an abscess could kill him if it burst
        under the skin. Or perhaps, Carlin surmised, because he had once been a
        member of the Russian Special Forces in Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>Carlin served as a volunteer doctor in Pakistan in 1988. Now, he
        said, two men who had been on opposite sides of a war came together by
        computer at sea.</p>
        <p>&quot;I needed him to do surgery on himself, and I didn't want him to
        be afraid,&quot; Carlin recalled. &quot;I really just stuck to the
        facts. I told him what we had to do to fix the arm, and he had already
        drawn the same conclusion. This guy is no stranger to pain.&quot;</p>
        <p>With four hours to go until sunset in the South Atlantic and the
        onset of Yazykov's communications blackout, Carlin sent him 13 steps of
        instructions on how to operate on his arm.</p>
        <p>The World Clinic had supplied all the sailing competitors with
        medical instruments, including two sterile scalpels, latex gloves,
        iodine, surgical scrub and some cotton gauze. Some competitors also had
        satellite telephones. But Yazykov could not afford that. So instead, he
        took the solar-powered device for beaming e-mail messages ashore.</p>
        <p>Carlin's step-by-step instructions on self-surgery got through --
        shortly before the transmission went dead for the night.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Yazykov said he had successfully punctured the abscess,
        but could not stop the bleeding. Nor could he move the fingers of his
        right hand.</p>
        <p>They had reached the lowest point of their ordeal. Yazykov, who never
        asked to be evacuated from his boat, was counting drops of blood and
        measuring the time he had left to live. Carlin sent him some questions
        and stayed up all night not knowing what had gone wrong.</p>
        <p>The next morning, Yazykov wrote that he had previously taken some
        aspirin to ease the pain of his injured elbow. Not realizing that
        aspirin thins blood and inhibits clotting, he had wrapped a tight cord
        around his arm to stop the bleeding, and his fingers went numb.</p>
        <p>Carlin immediately sent back an e-mail telling him to remove the
        tourniquet and apply direct pressure to the wound. The bleeding stopped,
        and Yazykov has since reported only minor weakness in his thumb and
        forefinger. He is expected to make a full recovery.</p>
        <p>&quot;The arm getting better,&quot; he wrote Carlin on Sunday.
        &quot;Very grateful to doctor.&quot;</p>

        <h2>Navy Telemedicine Initiative (US Government Work)</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;
        <h3>Present Situation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Currently in most ships video teleconferencing is being used for
            teleconsultation.</li>
          <li>One achievement is The Lincoln, which will sail with the most
            complete telemedicine suite ever used in any remote unit of the
            Navy. It has teleradiology capability, video conferencing and can
            communicate with a full teaching hospital wherever it is in the
            world.</li>
          <p>&nbsp;
          <h3>Uses of telemedicine for the Navy</h3>
          <li>Savings for the Navy in travel time and costs if there is a
            medical telepresence.</li>
          <p>&nbsp;
          <h3>Goals</h3>
          <li>A telelibrary where resources of any medical database from
            anywhere in the world can be accessed is needed.</li>
          <li>Provide health care to people on board of ships in middle of sea.</li>
          <p>&nbsp;
          <h3>Challenges</h3>
          <p>The main challenge faced is communication problem. Submarines
          present a specifically unique communication problem as they are
          submerged. These communication issues are not easy to solve.</p>
          <p>One particular problem is electromagnetic frequency saturation. An
          antenna on the deck of a ship will not work on its own but will create
          a ripple effect of impact on other communication units. Some of these
          ripple effects cannot be foreseen and when they arise, they can create
          detrimental effects on the communication mechanism.</p>
          <p>One example, which can be referred to, is as follows. The
          telemedicine unit on a ship was working perfectly until an EGS cruiser
          (which has one of the strongest radar in the world) pulled along and
          blew every circuit in that unit.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;
          <h3>What can be done</h3>
          It will not be possible to require other ships to turn off their
          anti-radar when they are passing by just so the Navy ships could
          transmit telemedical information. Instead what should be done is to
          try to integrate with existing communication assets.

          <h2>Distributed Virtual Environment for Intravascular Tele-Surgery
          Using Multimedia Telecommunication (Virtual Reality Annual International Symposium 1996)</h2>
          </a>
          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <li>Medical diagnostic systems such as CT (Computed Tomography) and
            MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) build 3D models of the body. By
            analysing the images, the patient can be examined and operations can
            be planned accurately.</li>
          <li>The catheter is a tool, which can be used for minimal invasive
            surgery, which reduces physical pain from the patient. The catheter
            is used for neurosurgical operations where it can go through the
            blood vessels deep into the brain.</li>
          <li>The number of specialised medical doctors is decreasing and it is
            important to help doctors in diagnosing and operating the
            intravascular surgical tools. To solve this problem, a distributed
            VR system using multimedia tele-communication for training,
            diagnosis and surgery can be proposed.</li>
          <li>To produce a system of this kind, the ability to exchange high
            quality moving pictures is required. Therefore a wide band optical
            fibre network and ATM will be used.</li>
          <li>A virtual simulator system for the operation of the catheter,
            which consists of 3D-computer graphics display and two kinds of
            joysticks are used. Force display and visual assistance method aid
            the doctor.</li>
          <li>Doctors in different places can operate on the patient and
            communicate to each other by exchanging information such as
            real-time colour images, sound, text data, numerical data, force
            info, etc.</li>
          <li>This experiment was performed between Tokyo and Nagoya, which are
            350 km apart. The operator in Tokyo controlled a catheter in the
            virtual environment in Nagoya.</li>
          <img src="../non-published%20files/public_html/publications/Pic1.jpg" width="250" height="167">
          <h3>Multimedia Telesurgery</h3>
          Due to high-speed communication technology, interactive communication
          between different places can be done. See figure 1. By using the
          multimedia network, information about patients can be exchanged. This
          means that several doctors in different places can collaborate and
          proper decision making can occur on a global communication. See figure
          2. <img src="../non-published%20files/public_html/publications/Pic2.jpg" width="262" height="254">
          <h3>Simulation</h3>
          <li><b>Why is simulation required? </b>The surface of the blood vessel
            in very sensitive so the operation of the catheter must be carefully
            performed. The handling time must also be reduced to reduce the pain
            from the patient. Therefore a simulator is required to train doctors
            in the handling of the catheter.</li>
          <li><b>What is a force display? </b>The orientation of the catheter’s
            tip can be controlled. A joystick which has two degrees of freedom
            controls the catheter. It consists of 2 DC motors each connected to
            by encoders that decode polar coordinates inputted by the operator.
            The DC motors apply feedback force to the operator based on the
            force acting on the catheter so it can be used as a force display.</li>

          <img src="../non-published%20files/public_html/publications/Pic4.jpg" width="229" height="175"><br>
          A new master slave device can rotate the catheter. See below:<br>
          <img src="../non-published%20files/public_html/publications/Pic5.jpg" width="278" height="198">
          <img src="../non-published%20files/public_html/publications/Pic6.jpg" width="335" height="279">
          <li><b>How is the virtual environment constructed?</b><br>
            The following conditions simplify the catheter model:
            <ol>
              1) The catheter bends with the same curvature
            </ol>
            <ol>
              2) Length of the active centre axis remains the same.
            </ol>
            <ol>
              3) Cross-section is always a circle.
            </ol>
            <img src="../non-published%20files/public_html/publications/Pic7.jpg" width="267" height="224">
            <ol>
              4) The catheter moves along the curvature when its tip contacts
              the blood vessel wall with its top surface and the blood vessel
              wall being perpendicular.
            </ol>
            <ol>
              5) The catheter moves forward and backward limited to the
              perpendicular direction of the non-active base section of the
              active units.
            </ol>
          </li>
          <br>
          <img src="../non-published%20files/public_html/publications/Pic8.jpg" width="234" height="291">
          Cylinders of different diameters model the blood vessel.<br>
          <li><b>How does the force feedback control method work?</li>
          </b><br>
          The system detects the contact state at the tip of the catheter. The
          coordinate state of the tip centre of the catheter is defined below: <img src="../non-published%20files/public_html/publications/Pic9.jpg" width="261" height="78"><br>
          <br>
          Where (thetad1, thetad2) is input value from the joystick and (alphac,
          thetac) are the required angles. The tip centre of the catheter is
          defined as follows:<br>
          <img src="../non-published%20files/public_html/publications/Pic10.jpg" width="375" height="49"><br>
          The position of the catheter is calculated where the tip intersects
          the blood vessel.<br>
          <img src="../non-published%20files/public_html/publications/Pic11.jpg" width="262" height="202">
          <img src="../non-published%20files/public_html/publications/Pic12.jpg" width="554" height="312">
          <h3>Visualisation</h3>
          The tip of the catheter is too thin for a vision sensor to be placed
          there. 2D images of X rays are used so viewpoint selection is very
          important. A cylinder approximates the blood vessel and the direction
          of the vessel is represented by the cylinder axis. See below: <img src="../non-published%20files/public_html/publications/Pic13.jpg" width="319" height="185">
          <h3>The Experiment</h3>
          A multimedia teleoperation was performed between Nagoya and Tokyo.
          High-speed optical fibre network of 156 Mbps between Nagoya and Tokyo
          was used. The operator in Tokyo controlled the catheter in Nagoya
          using a joystick. The time delay of the catheter was 11.29ms that is
          insignificant for the operation. The operator could also communicate
          to people at different locations at the same time. The motion of the
          catheter was stable and the operator could feel force reflections when
          the catheter pushed the blood vessel wall in Nagoya. The operation was
          successful.<br>
