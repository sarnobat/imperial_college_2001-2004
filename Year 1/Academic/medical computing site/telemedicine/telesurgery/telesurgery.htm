        <p class="title" align="center">Telesurgery</p>
        </b>
        <h2>What it is</h2>
        <p>As the name suggests, it is possible to perform surgery from afar,
        without making direct contact with the patient. A term which tends to be
        used for the same idea is Minimally Invasive Surgery(MIS). There would
        appear to be a subtle difference simply in the wording, as MIS doesn’t
        imply that it is carried out at a distance. For all intents and
        purposes, we shall consider them interchangeable as they work
        conceptually in the same way.</p>
        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>MIS was introduced in the 1980’s. While previous surgery on a
        patient’s thorax would involve huge incisions, this new technique
        merely punctures the surface and enable entry of endoscopic tools
        (connected to a computer) to the operation site. The tools are
        controlled by a human surgeon another computer connected to the first.
        The advantage of MIS is that it damages far less healthy tissue, meaning
        less post-operative pain and a quicker recovery, hence a shorter stay in
        hospital and less use of hospital resources.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="../../non-published%20files/public_html/telemedicine/telesurgery/MIS.jpg" align="middle" width="593" height="238"></p>
        <h2>More about its components</h2>
        <p>To discover how a typical surgeon-robot combination achieves its goal
        we consider features from several telesurgical systems, such as the
        daVinci System and the UC Berkely-UC San Francisco system.</p>
        <h3>The Surgeon’s Station</h3>
        <p>Clearly no matter where the surgeon physically is, he or she must be
        able to see what is being operated on. Providing simple video images
        from an endoscopic camera is unsatisfactory, as it would be impossible
        to appreciate depth and thus hand-eye co-ordiation is lost. However,
        thanks to advances in graphics technology a greater sense of realism is
        obtainable by 3D images. These are created using two 3-chip CCD cameras
        inside the patient’s thorax and are separately transmitted to one of
        two medical CRT monitors in a <a href="hmd.htm">Head Mounted Display </a>worn by
        the surgeon. The thorax must be inflated with carbon dioxide so that
        suitable camera angles may be taken up.</p>
        <p>The handles which the surgeon uses (the masters) serve two purposes.
        The first is as an input device, encoding movements made by the surgeon
        that will later be decoded and copied by the robotic arms (the slaves).
        The handlers are very sensitive to movement, but it is often preferable
        to pre-program removal of the surgeon’s hand tremors into the digital
        encoder. The masters secondly serve as output devices, giving <a href="feedback.htm">force
        feedback</a> which the slaves experience during their actions.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="../../non-published%20files/public_html/telemedicine/telesurgery/masters.jpg" align="center"></p>
        <p>Alternatively, the surgery could be voice controlled.</p>
        <p>The surgeon’s console also contains the <a href="controller.htm">controller</a>.</p>
        <h3>The Operation Station</h3>
        <p>The patient-side console contains manipulators which supply the
        decoded signals of the masters inputs. There are 3 of them, to which two
        slaves are connected at any one time (in this particular system; others
        could well have more) corresponding to what the surgeon would is
        virtually holding. The puncture in the patient’s body through which
        the slaves are placed is approximately 10mm in diameter. The slaves
        include scalpels, needles and graspers among others. The graspers,
        equivalent to the surgeon’s fingers, would seem rather limited as they
        do not have the flexibility of a human wrist. However, many systems are
        keen to incorporate ‘degrees of freedom’ which are equivalent to the
        vertical flexibility of a human wrist (in the daVinci system, 7 degrees
        of freedom are given).</p>

        <p>As of October 1999, M.I.S. has been used in over 500 different
        variations of surgery including nissen fundoplication, cholecystectomy,
        hernia repair, tubal reanastomosis, gastroplasty, appendectomy,
        arteriovenous fistula, intra-rectal surgery, lysis of adhesions,
        hysterectomy, lumbar sympathectomy, toupet surgery and colorectal
        surgery.</p>
