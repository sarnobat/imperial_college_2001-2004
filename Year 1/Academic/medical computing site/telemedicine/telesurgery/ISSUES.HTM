        <p class="title" align="center">Practical Issues</p>
        <p>There are many potential problems with this technology that have had
        little or no impact on conventional surgery. Here are just a few
        considerations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>Software</h3>
            The software is highly complex as there any many mechanical,
            electrical, computational and even communication components to
            interface. This hinders the surgeon’s demand for user-friendly,
            intuitive control of the system. The days when a surgeon can control
            the system abstractly without supervision by an expert with
            knowledge of the internal system aren’t quite reality.</li>
          <br>
          <br>
          <li>
            <h3>The surgeon</h3>
            A fully qualified, experienced surgeon is likely to encounter
            difficulty in using a telesurgical system simply because his or her
            ‘picture’ of the operation is much more restricted. Feedback is
            no replacement for physical presence.</li>
          <br>
          <br>
          <li>
            <h3>Time delays</h3>
            If the surgery is being carried out at a different site to the
            controller, the time delay in the digital signals reaching either
            station cannot be overlooked. A surgeon may start cutting before
            realizing that he or she is grasping the wrong tissue causing
            unnecessary damage. The surgeon must carry out a procedure at a much
            slower and deliberate pace.</li>
          <br>
          <br>
          <li>
            <h3>Reliability assessment</h3>
            It is difficult using mathematical techniques to calculate the mean
            time between faults in any part of the system. Engineers rely on
            this in their equipment specification. Again, this is due to the
            system complexity already mentioned.</li>
          <br>
          <br>
          <li>
            <h3>Fault tolerance</h3>
            A fact of life in any software or hardware is bug or fault which the
            system must be able to deal with. Obvious faults can be trapped and
            corrected but those which occur under rare conditions are difficult
            to identify.</li>
          <br>
          <br>
          <li>
            <h3>Security</h3>
            ‘Where there is technology there is trouble’ seems to be a
            recurring theme in the 21st century. Personal data stored and shared
            with 3rd parties violates the privacy of the public. More
            worryingly, hackers could be capable of interfering with an
            operation. Confidence in conventional surgery cannot be matched.</li>
          <br>
          <br>
          <li>
            <h3>Maintainability</h3>
            Nothing mechanical is immune to deterioration and so maintaining
            (e.g. sterilizing, replacing) equipment is a much larger task than
            ever before. This could prove tricky if part of a system is in a
            remote area of the world (which is surely one of the motives of
            telesurgery).</li>
          <br>
          <br>
          <li>
            <h3>Consistency</h3>
            Surgeons must have total confidence that a system will perform
            consistently in different procedures, which is easier demanded than
            achieved.
