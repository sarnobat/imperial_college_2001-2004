        <p class="title" align="center">The Home Asthma Telemonitoring (HAT)
        System</p>
        <h2>Why it was developed</h2>
        <p>Conventional asthma management consists of a patient regularly
        checking their peak expiratory flow (PEF) which is expressed as a
        percentage, using medication, and following an action plan suggested by
        his or her physician (simply a set of lifestyle guidelines) based on the
        PEF value.</p>
        <p>This has worked well for many years. However, recent studies showed
        that patients did not follow their actions plans closely, frequently
        didn’t take their medication and reported inaccurate PEF values to
        their physicians.</p>
        <p>The HAT system establishes a long term link between the patient and
        physician.</p>
        <h2>What the system consists of</h2>
        <p align="center"><img src="../../non-published%20files/public_html/telemedicine/telemonitoring/asthma_components.jpg" width="512" height="197"></p>
        <p>The system is made of three components - a patient unit, a clinician
        station and a decision support server.</p>
        <p>The <b>patient unit </b>is a palmtop with an electronic flowmeter
        (similar to that conventionally used) connected to it.<br>
        The palmtop stores the last 4 months of data locally for the patient’s
        immediate access. The full data set is stored on a database in the
        information server having been sent from the palmtop via a secure web
        interface.<br>
        The palmtop checks whether the new data is consistent with that recorded
        previously, before the decision support server carries out any analysis
        of its own.</p>
        <p>The <b>decision support server</b>, in addition to interpreting
        changes in the data, ensures that the patient is carrying out the test
        sessions at the required times. It sends alert messages to the medical
        staff if the patient doesn’t carry out the test session on time, or
        doesn’t stick to the suggested medication doses or action plan (though
        it relies on what the patient has told it).</p>
        <p>The staff at the <b>monitoring center </b>check for alerts daily on
        their workstations with special monitoring software. They can then
        contact the patients and take appropriate action.<br>
        If these alerts are generated outside of working hours then the system
        automatically calls the nurse’s home telephone.<br>
        The nurse may access the data through any web browser.</p>
        <h2>What a typical patient monitoring session involves</h2>
        <p>The patient goes through the familiar procedure of using the
        flowmeter, after being asked to answer some routine questions.</p>
        <p>The palmtop analyses both these data, and alerts the medical staff as
        well as the patient himself/herself if the data gives cause for concern.</p>
        <p>Then the palmtop generates a simple qualitative summary of the latest
        test results and finally, as an extra, gives the patient a ‘tip of the
        day’ and asks a few multiple choice questions about asthma to improve
        the patients knowledge of the disease as it may be invaluable some day.</p>
        <p>Click <a href="session.ppt">here</a> to see a pseudo-interactive test program.</p>
        <p>The program is based on Social Cognitive Theory, which (among many
        other things) anticipates the patient’s mood and responds in suitable
        ways. It attempts to keep the patient’s self-esteem high by controlled
        praise, feedback and setting realistic targets.</p>
        <h2>Data Reporting</h2>
        <p>There are 3 types of report:
        <blockquote>
          <ul>
            <li>Provider</li>
            <li>Patient</li>
            <li>Alert</li>
          </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The <b>Provider Report</b>, sent at least once every month to the
        physician, presents information in numerical table format and flags any
        data worth bringing to the physician’s attention. It also includes the
        extent of the patient’s knowledge (based on their performance in the
        multiple choice questions), and the extent of their obedience to their
        medication dosage and action plan.</p>
        <p>The <b>Patient Report</b>, sent at least once every month to the
        patient, attempts to cover the same information but in narrative form.
        It also attempts to convince the patient that a weak adherence to their
        medication regimen is the cause of their symptoms, should any occur.</p>
        <p>The <b>Alert Report </b>is a special version of the Provider Report
        generated when significantly worse asthma symptoms develop. These
        reports are treated so seriously that they are automatically faxed
        directly and immediately to the physician (rather than the nurse) and
        confirmation of this fax receipt by telephone is mandatory.</p>
        <h2>Has the system been a success?</h2>
        <p>Evaluation studies of the HAT system have provided positive results
        and it seems this is the long term future of managing not only asthma
        but many other illnesses.
