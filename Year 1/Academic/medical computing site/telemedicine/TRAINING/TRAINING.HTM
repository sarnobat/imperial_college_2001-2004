        Telemedicine Applications</p>
        </b>
        <p>This section deals with training and improvement of skills of the
        medical staff through different applications of telemedicine. The three
        main parts covered here are:
        <blockquote>
          <ul>
            <li>Use of networks for sharing information</li>
            <li>Use of intelligent search tools for finding telemedical sites
              for more information</li>
            <li>Telemedicine video conferencing</li>
          </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>Use of networks to share information</h2>
        <p>Networks with different levels of information to cater for needs of
        different groups are set up to improve knowledge of general
        practitioners.
        <blockquote>

            </li>
            <p>These consist of a series of questions which can be asked and
            answered prior to consultation by a physician.</p>

              <h3>Multimedia database set to share the known information</h3>
            </li>
            <p>Data files containing medical information are put on the web. The
            data consists of texts like medical findings and interviews, images
            like x-ray of a skull, digital bio signals and video with sound. Any
            WWW browser can be used to view textual data, images and video data
            while the biosignals can be run under a Java viewer developed for
            this format.</p>

          <h2>Video Conferencing</h2>
          Video conferencing is used in many telemedicine applications and
          following recent advances in technology effective video conferencing
          systems have been developed. This section considers mainly the quality
          attributes of modern video conferencing as far as the technical
          details are concerned. The main aim is to produce an environment as
          close as possible to real life. The main aspects of the technology
          are:
          <blockquote>
            <h3>1. Motion Handling</h3>
            This is thought to be one of the key technological attributes of
            video conferencing. Usually video conferencing is conducted at 30
            frames per second and this affects the flow of the image. Low image
            precision and blurring have to be avoided. As constant motion occurs
            the coder/decoder (CODEC) has to constantly refresh the image. As
            such, hardware CODECs are recommended as they produce faster and
            cleaner images. Blurring effects along the perimeters of high
            contrast areas are prevented. Motion handling is especially
            important when viewing rapid movement like foetal heart beat.
            <h3>2. Image Resolution</h3>
            The image resolution quality depends on the on the resolution of the
            camera receiving the image and the monitor which is projecting the
            image. Usually special cameras with different chip sets, which
            determine the video quality, are used to zoom in the image depending
            on the specific cases.
            <h3>3. Audio Clarity</h3>
            A high quality of sound is required so that the medical staff can
            hear the right thing and not have to worry about sounds produced in
            the communication lines (noise). There should be no loss of words or
            break-up, a high signal to noise ratio and no feedback. Different
            levels of audio clarity are required in different situations, e.g.
            if a device like an electronic stethoscope is being used, special
            equipment is needed to transmit the sounds. In other cases
            microphones and speakers are all that is required for audio clarity.
            <h3>4. Synchronization</h3>
            There should be a synchronisation between audio and video
            transmissions without delay effects.
            <h3>5. Peripheral Sophistication</h3>
            Basic medical video conferencing equipment can be adapted to
            different situations. Usually peripheral devices like electronic
            cardiogram, which enhance medical capabilities, can be accepted in
            most video conferencing equipment and this increases efficiency.
            <h3>6. Ergonomic</h3>
            Video conferencing equipment is made ergonomic, i.e. mobile and
            efficient. Equipment should not be too bulky.
            <h3>7. Interoperability</h3>
            Strong telecommunication standards are needed to facilitate
            interoperability, i.e. all the components like the monitor, the
            cameras, etc. have to work together.
          </blockquote>
          <p>Other aspects apart from technological attributes also have to be
          considered. These include:
          <blockquote>
          </blockquote>
          <li>Usability attributes</li>
          <li>Physical environment attributes</li>
          <li>Human element attributes</li>
          <p>&nbsp;
          <h3>Uses of video conferencing:</h3>
          <blockquote>
          </blockquote>
          <li>Medical Staff education</li>
          <li>Peer consultation</li>
          <li>Patient Education</li>
          <li>Direct Patient Care<br>
            This requires highest degree of video conferencing due to its direct
            and immediate impact on patient care.</li>
