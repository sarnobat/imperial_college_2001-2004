<h2>Virtual Reality (VR)</h2>

<h3>What it is</h3>
<p>
VR, quite simply, is the simulation of a 3D environment on a 2D display. In medical applications, one strives to simulate the 3D structure of various parts of the human body on a 2D display, be that an HMD, monitors viewed with red-blue glasses, or Binocular Omni Orientational Monitors.
</p>
<h3>Acuiring data</h3>
<p>
The structural data is obtained from CT, MRI and other scanning devices. The different data from each (i.e. bone structure from CT, soft tissue structure from MRI) can be superimposed to convey the information exhibited by both. Furthermore, several (i.e. hundreds) of layers of these 2D images can be stacked on top of each other to give a 3D structure with the information from all scan types using image rendering software such as <a href ="http://www.ablesw.com/3d-doctor/volume.html">3D-Doctor</a>.

<h3>Rendering Performance</h3>
<p>
Traversal of a 3D structure, whose data file takes up 100’s of Mbytes, is computationally very demanding. The whole data set is being rendered when significant portions of it are invisible to the viewer (e.g. a brain behind the skull). This type of rendering is called Volume Rendering. In many cases the performance can be improved by using Surface Rendering where only the visible surfaces are processed. However, even this isn’t ideal as determining the visible surfaces is itself a computationally costly procedure.
</p>
<p>
Either way, huge numbers of polygons will be generated and the CPU is working overtime to process them. Graphics hardware similar to that used in computer games takes the burden off the CPU increasing performance, as well as improving image quality.
</p>

<p>It may be necessary to assign planes to particular organs where behaviour simulation is key. The viewer may wish to move one organ independently from the others, render them invisible to avoid obscuring other structures (as in this video), or see how they change shape when applying pressure. Plastic surgery benefits from this capability.
</p>

<h2>Augmented Reality (AR)</h2>

<h3>What it is</h3>
<p>
AR essentially attempts to manipulate the best features of both virtual reality and the real world itself: the low cost associated with Virtual Reality compared to the construction and use of a real world equivalent; and the appeal of the real world to the user’s perception of a scene.
</p>

<p>
The computer-generated objects can be viewed on a PC or, better still, with and HMD which views the real objects too. In fact, Augmented Reality is closer to the real world because it is predominantly made up of real world objects; computer generated objects feature much more sparsely (Augmented Virtuality would be closer to VR than the real world).
</p>
<h3>Where it’s used</h3>
<p>A simple, albeit not completely genuine example of AR in use is the weather forecast. The reporter stands in front of a blank blue screen but to those viewing it on TV, it appears as though the reporter is standing in front of a map. This isn’t a pure example because there is no interaction between the real and virtual objects.
</p>
<p>
In medicine, AR can have a wide range of uses particularly in surgery. Conventionally, surgeons operate on a patient while frequently consulting 2D CT or MRI images. Aside from the limits of 2D images, the surgeon would have to look back and forth during the procedure. AR allows the surgeon to see everything in one view.

<p>
Thus, it would be easier to detect tumours, cysts or abnormal blood vessels, and even ‘see’ the surgical instruments and surgeon’s own hands buried in the patient’s body. It is as if the irrelevant parts of the patient’s body are invisible.
</p>
<p>
AR can also be useful for practicing plastic surgery where a skull model changes shape according to actions by a surgeon wearing datagloves (i.e. gloves with attached sensors that monitor the hand movements).
</p>

<p>
Indeed, many more operations can be practised with the aid of AR, so that the surgeon is more confident and experienced when a real patient’s well-being is at stake.
