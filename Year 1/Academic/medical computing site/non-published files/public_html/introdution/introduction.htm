 <img src = "intro.jpg" align ="right" width="277" height="255">A lot of progress has been made in the medical field in the past century. Major breakthroughs include the discovery of blood, 
the introduction of the cardiogram, the development of penicillin and the discovery of DNA, amongst others.  Other achievements like the introduction of the CAT scan involve not only medical knowledge but rather, a combination of other scientific fields (in this case branches of physics) and medicine.  It was not until later in the past century that improvement in the medical field was done with the use of computers.  Today, we have come to a point where it is impossible to picture the medical world functioning satisfactorily without the use of computers.

Indeed computers are nowadays very much in use in the medical field. They are essential to perform a wide range of tasks, ranging from hospital management (use of database systems) to more technically oriented uses like:

<li><a href="viz_analysis.html">visualization and analysis</a></li> of these images
<li>use of <a href="imaging.html">virtual and augmented reality</a> to produce medical images</li>
</blockquote>

and to help the medical staff in other ways.  This web site deals briefly with these sections and concentrates more on telemedicine.  This is a rather more recent use of computers in medicine and makes use of various computing principles like computer imaging, computer software and hardware and also a lot more on networking.
