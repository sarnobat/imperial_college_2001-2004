MEDICAL IMAGING
</p>

<p>
The 6 important concepts of medical imaging in computing are given briefly below: 
</p>

<h2>
Enhancement
</h2>  
The ability to extract visual information from objects between which there is little contrast is essential in medical diagnostics. Enhancement reduces noise from the interesting part of the image. This means that the eye sees the images more easily and it aids the automatic analysis system.   
<h2>
Segmentation
</h2> 
Segmentation is an area of crossover between Medical Imaging, and Medical Image Visualization and Analysis. Accurate image segmentation is one of the key problems in computer visualization. Segmentation divides an image into sections, which have the same property. In brain mapping and radiation treatment planning, images are created from CT or MRI scans of patients, their boundaries of objects must be identified before the objects can be reconstructed into 3D models. Automatic methods for finding these boundaries cause errors due to low contrast between adjacent soft tissues, and so segmentation is done manually to find the outlines of the important structures on each image. 

<h2>
Quantification 
</h2>
This is used to extract the important diagnostic data such as shape, size, texture, angle, and motion from an image. For example, if a surgeon were replacing a hip joint, quantification would assist in deciding how large the implant would need to be in order to fit the patient.  

<h2>
Registration 
</h2>
Image registration determines correspondence between all points in two images of the same scene, and solves the problem of combining 3D information from two views of a patient. This is a time consuming task because of the large amounts of data that needs to be analysed. Continual work is being done in registration to improve algorithms to make use of new computer architectures. 

<h2>
Visualization
</h2>
 
Visualization is another area of crossover with Medical Imaging, and Medical Image Visualization and Analysis. It concerns making medical images easily visualized, in order to support further analysis of the images.   

<h2>

Compression, Storage and Communication

</h2>Image compression reduces the image size, so that all the scans take up less memory space on the hospital computers. This also means quicker communication between different units or possibly different hospitals as smaller files can be transferred quicker. This increases the efficiency in diagnosis methods and means that a patient can be treated quickly.
