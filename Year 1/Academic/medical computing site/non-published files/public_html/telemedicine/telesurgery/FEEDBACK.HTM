<h2>Why it is needed in surgery</h2>
<p>With MIS, the fact that the surgeon is no longer in physical contact with the patient means that he or she cannot gain invaluable diagnostic information by touch. This ability to feel makes it easier to identify, among other things, major pulses and thickened walls which could signify infected or even cancerous tissue.
</p>
<p>
To restore some of this information, a Force Feedback Endoscopic Grasper (FREG) could be used. It has only been developed in recent years and has not been perfected.
</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>
The theory of how it works involves much material physics. 
</p>

<p>
Briefly, the motor torque driving the FREG, along with other measurements can be used to calculate constants to associate with the material the FREG is in contact with. Software is programmed into the slave computer which matches these constants with experimental data held in a database to identify the material. 
</p>

<p>
Appropriate tactile feedback is sent to the masters so that the surgeon can get a feel for what the organ he or she is operating on might be.
</p>
<p>
The graph below gives some material analysis data from which constants can be calculated (the relationship is exponential).

<h2>Electro-controlled stiffness feedback</h2>

<p>
To consider how feedback of stiffness is sent to the surgeon we consider the MEMICA haptic system in which the masters are ‘gloves’ (i.e. controls worn over the fingers). Whenever the slaves encounter resistance, the information is sent back to the pistons in the glove which increase in friction via the brakes (using electromagnetic principles) and hence the surgeon experiences the same resistance.
