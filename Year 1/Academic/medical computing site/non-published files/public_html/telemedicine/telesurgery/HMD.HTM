<h2>Types of HMD</h2>

<p>There are two broad categories of HMDs: low resolution and high resolution. </p>

<p><b>Low resolution</b> HMDs use LCD displays  (like those found on old laptops) and are unsuitable for medical application. They can only give resolutions of up to 240 TV lines.
</p>

<p>

<p><b>High resolution</b> displays, which use cathode ray tubes (like those found in TVs), are capable of resolutions of 1000 TV lines on display areas as small as 21 x 28 mm. 
</p>
<p>Creating images at slightly different angles for each eye gives a 3D image to the viewer.
</p>
<p>However, they can only display monochrome images.

<h2>
Colourizing monochrome images
</h2>

<p>
The method which gave us colour television (<i>spatial colour-pixel</i> )  is unsuitable because with the panel being so close to the eye that the pixels are too large to convince a viewer that the image is really coloured. 
</p>

<p>
The <i><b>temporal field-sequential</b></i> approach is much more effective. This simply involves switching between red, green and blue filters (in the shutter) at a high rate (about 180 Hz) giving the viewer the impression of real colour images (at a refresh rate of 60 Hz).
</p>

<h2>
Other uses
</h2>
<p>
They have many uses besides in medicine.
