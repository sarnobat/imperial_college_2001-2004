<h2>Why we need it</h2>
<p>One of the most important problems our society is facing is the increase in percentage of senior citizens, owing to lower birth rates and higher life expectancy.
</p>
<p>
With more senior citizens, there are more people whose health status is in decline. They are less mobile and so health care professionals are frequently requested to travel to the patient rather than vice versa. The health care system simply cannot cope with
the increasing numbers.
</p>
<p>
Telemonitoring not only cuts out a large proportion of the travelling (by either party), but often results in better knowledge of the patient’s condition due to the greater amount of data
being measured.
</p>
<h2>Who uses it?</h2>
<p>
Specialists in many areas such as:
<blockquote>

<li>Cardiology</li><br>
<li>Orthopaedics</li><br>
<li>Dermatology</li><br>
<li>Psychiatry</li>
</blockquote>


<p>
make use of telemonitoring.
</p>


<p>
We shall consider two simple systems, which monitor patients who suffer from:
</p>
<blockquote>
<li><a href = "asthma.html">asthma</a></li>
<li><a href = "ecg.html">heart problems</a></li>
<blockquote>
</body>
