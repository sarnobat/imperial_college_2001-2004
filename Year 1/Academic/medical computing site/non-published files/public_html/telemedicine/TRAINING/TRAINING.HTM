<b><p class = "title" align = "center">Training and Education through Telemedicine Applications</p></b>
<p> 
This section deals with training and improvement of skills of the medical staff through different applications of telemedicine. The three main parts covered here are:
<blockquote>
<li>Use of networks for sharing information</li>
<li>Use of intelligent search tools for finding telemedical sites for more information</li>
<li>Telemedicine video conferencing</li>
</blockquote>
<h2>Use of networks to share information</h2>
<p>
Networks with different levels of information to cater for needs of different groups are set up to improve knowledge of general practitioners.

<blockquote>
<li><h3>Expert systems</h3></li>
<p>These consist of a series of questions which can be asked and answered prior to consultation by a physician.</p>
<li><h3>Interactive tutorials</h3></li>
<li><h3>Multimedia database set to share the known information</h3></li>
<p>
Data files containing medical information are put on the web.  The data consists of texts like medical findings and interviews, images like x-ray of a skull, digital bio signals and video with sound.  Any WWW browser can be used to view textual data, images and video data while the biosignals can be run under a Java viewer developed for this format.
</p>

<h2>Networking and Intelligent Search tools</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<li>Medical practitioners making use of these search tools to find information on the Internet</li>
<li>Description of the search algorithm:</li>
 </blockquote>
  <blockquote><blockquote>
<li type = "circle">
User types in keyword.&nbsp;<br></li>
<li type = "circle">
Keyword sent to search sites.&nbsp;<br></li>
<li type = "circle">
This gives a set of sites on which the scanner is run.&nbsp;<br></li>
<li type = "circle">
The scanner will give the general properties of the sites.&nbsp;<br></li>
<li type = "circle">
Sites are evaluated by use of a decision tree.&nbsp;<br></li>
<li type = "circle">
Sites chosen are sent to a database.&nbsp;<br></li>
<li type = "circle">
These sites are also sent to spider.&nbsp;<br></li>
<li type = "circle">Good links are then sent to scanner and their attributes are measured.</li>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<h2>Video Conferencing</h2>

Video conferencing is used in many telemedicine applications and following recent advances in technology effective video conferencing systems have been developed.
This section considers mainly the quality attributes of modern video conferencing as far as the technical details are concerned.  The main aim is to produce an environment as close as possible to real life.

The main aspects of the technology are:
<blockquote>
<h3>1.	Motion Handling</h3>

This is thought to be one of the key technological attributes of video conferencing.  Usually video conferencing is conducted at 30 frames per second and this affects the flow of the image.  Low image precision and blurring have to be avoided.  As constant motion occurs the coder/decoder (CODEC) has to constantly refresh the image.  As such, hardware CODECs are recommended as they produce faster and cleaner images.  Blurring effects along the perimeters of high contrast areas are prevented.
Motion handling is especially important when viewing rapid movement like foetal heart beat.



<h3>2.	Image Resolution</h3>

The image resolution quality depends on the on the resolution of the camera receiving the image and the monitor which is projecting the image.  Usually special cameras with different chip sets, which determine the video quality, are used to zoom in the image depending on the specific cases.

<h3>3.	Audio Clarity</h3>

A high quality of sound is required so that the medical staff can hear the right thing and not have to worry about sounds produced in the communication lines (noise).  There should be no loss of words or break-up, a high signal to noise ratio and no feedback.  Different levels of audio clarity are required in different situations, e.g. if a device like an electronic stethoscope is being used, special equipment is needed to transmit the sounds.  In other cases microphones and speakers are all that is required for audio clarity. 

<h3>4.	Synchronization</h3>

There should be a synchronisation between audio and video transmissions without delay effects.

<h3>5.	Peripheral Sophistication</h3>

Basic medical video conferencing equipment can be adapted to different situations.  Usually peripheral devices like electronic cardiogram, which enhance medical capabilities, can be accepted in most video conferencing equipment and this increases efficiency.

<h3>6.	Ergonomic</h3>

Video conferencing equipment is made ergonomic, i.e. mobile and efficient.  Equipment should not be too bulky.

<h3>7.	Interoperability</h3>

Strong telecommunication standards are needed to facilitate interoperability, i.e. all the components like the monitor, the cameras, etc.  have to work together.

<p>
Other aspects apart from technological attributes also have to be considered. These include:
<blockquote>
<li>Usability attributes</li>
<li>Physical environment attributes</li>
<li>Human element attributes</li>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
<h3>Uses of video conferencing:</h3>
<blockquote>
<li>Medical Staff education</li>
<li>Peer consultation</li>
<li>Patient Education</li>
<li>Direct Patient Care <br>
This requires highest degree of video conferencing due to its direct and immediate impact on patient care.</li>
