<h2>What is telemedicine?</h2>
</font>
<p>Telemedicine is the use of electronic information and
communications technologies to provide and support health care when distance
separates the patients from the professionals.</p>
<font color="blue">
<h2>Who is telemedicine of interest to?</h2>
</font>
<p>Many professions are involved in the administration and planning of
telemedicine. Here are the main ones:
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Primary Care Practitioners</li>
    <br>
    <li>Billing/Insurance companies</li>
    <br>
    <li>Outreach Clinics</li>
    <br>
    <li>Grant Writers</li>
    <br>
    <li>Outcome Analysts</li>
    <br>
    <li>Continuing Education personnel</li>
    <br>
    <li>Engineers</li>
    <br>
    <li>Computing Specialists</li>
    <br>
    <li>Information Professionals</li>
    <br>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<font color="blue">
<h2>In what contexts of medicine might it be used?</h2>
</font>
<p>There is a wide range of areas in which telemedicine is being used:</p>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Primary Health Care</li>
    <br>
    <li>Monitoring and diagnosis</li>
    <br>
    <li>Consultancy</li>
    <br>
    <li>Education</li>
    <br>
    <li>Surgery</li>
    <br>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>to name but a few.</p>
<font color="blue">
<h2>What is the common ingredient in all telemedical applications?</h2>
</font>
<p>In one word, the INTERNET is responsible for growth of telemedicine. Tasks
which would have taken hours/days/weeks can now be accomplished in seconds all
because of the speed of electrical conduction.</p>
<font color="blue">
<h2>Do we really need telemedicine?</h2>
</font>
<p>In a report carried out in 1997, it was estimated that 15.6m adults were
searching for online health information (which was about 43% of all internet
users at the time). The figure has been increasing by tens of millions every
year since.</p>
<p>Medical facilities are not available with equal ease to all the population.
Those:</p>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>living in remote areas</li>
    <br>
    <li>limited by travel or time costs</li>
    <br>
    <li>the elderly</li>
    <br>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>are all awaiting the benefits of telemedicine’s evolution.</p>
<font color="blue">
<h2>Where in the world is telemedicine being practised?</h2>
</font>
<p>In 1998, it was reported that there were over 200 active programs throughout
the world in countries such as:</p>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Chile</li>
    <br>
    <li>India</li>
    <br>
    <li>Israel</li>
    <br>
    <li>Japan</li>
    <br>
    <li>Scotland</li>
    <br>
    <li>Taiwan</li>
    <br>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>157 of the 200 were in rural areas of the USA.</p>
<p>Considering the advances in the fields mentioned above since 1998, the given
figures are likely to have changed significantly.</p>
<p>(in 1993, there were only 10 active programs)</p>
<font color="blue">
<h2>So how does telemedicine work?</h2>
</font>
<p>This is a rather specific question, as there are many contexts as we have
discovered.</p>
<p>To give an indication of the sort of telemedical systems, the way the work
and their implications, we consider a few areas:</p>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><a href = "/telesurgery/telesurgery.html">Telesurgery</a></li>
    <br>
    <li><a href = "/telemonitoring/telemonitoring.html">Telemonitoring</a></li>
    <br>
    <li><a href = "/training/training.html">Teletraining</a></li>
    <br>
    <li><a href = "/teleradiology/teleradiology.html">Teleradiology</a></li>
    <br>
  </ul>
