<h2>NAVY TELEMEDICINE INITIATIVE</h2>

<p>
<h3>Present Situation</h3>
<li>Currently in most ships video teleconferencing is being used for teleconsultation.</li>
<li>One achievement is The Lincoln, which will sail with the most complete telemedicine suite ever used in any remote unit of the Navy.  It has teleradiology capability, video conferencing and can communicate with a    full teaching hospital wherever it is in the world.
</li>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Uses of telemedicine for the Navy</h3>

<li>Savings for the Navy in travel time and costs if there is a medical telepresence.</li>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Goals</h3>
<li>A telelibrary where resources of any medical database from anywhere in the world can be accessed is needed.</li>
<li>Provide health care to people on board of ships in middle of sea.</li>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Challenges</h3> 
<p>
The main challenge faced is communication problem.  Submarines present a specifically unique communication problem as they are submerged.  These communication issues are not easy to solve. 
</p>
<p>
One particular problem is electromagnetic frequency saturation.  An antenna on the deck of a ship will not work on its own but will create a ripple effect of impact on other communication units.  Some of these ripple effects cannot be foreseen and when they arise, they can create detrimental effects on the communication mechanism.
</p>
<p>
One example, which can be referred to, is as follows.  The telemedicine unit on a ship was working perfectly until an EGS cruiser (which has one of the strongest radar in the world) pulled along and blew every circuit in that unit. 
</p>
</p>

<p>
<h3>What can be done</h3>
It will not be possible to require other ships to turn off their anti-radar when they are passing by just so the Navy ships could transmit telemedical information.  Instead what should be done is to try to integrate with existing communication assets.
