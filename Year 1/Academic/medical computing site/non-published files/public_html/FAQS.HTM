<h3>How come telemedicine isn't available at my local hospital?</h3>
<p>
Firstly, are you sure that that is indeed the case? It may just be that it is not well-publicised, or only available for exceptional cases.
<br>
<br>
If you are certain they are not present, then the simple reason woud be that it is a relatively new technology where small-scale trial rather than conventional service is being carried out. Discovery date to common practice may be longer than you expect: the first human open-heart surgery was performed in 1957(????????) yet even today it isn't considered a routine operation.
</p>

<h3>I have come here to find out about how telemedicine affects society, yet I mostly find computer jargon. Why should I want to know about this?</h3>
<p>
While efforst have been made to deliver a balanced discussion of this field, it is aimed at those with a sound technical knowledge. The site has been developed by college Computing students, with an emphasis on <i>how</i> the computer aids advances in medicine.
</p>

<h3>You say that telemedicine is needed because the health care units cannot cope with demand. Why?</h3>
<p>
The simple fact is that with world population on the increase. It was recently estimated at 4.6 billion, and the figure is increasing by the second.
<br>
<br>
Even though the number of health care professionals is also increasing, it isn't doing so as rapidly as the general population.
</p>

<h3>Surely there is a flip-side to this new technology?</h3>
<p>
Of course. Any change in an established service or policy will have its sceptics.
<br>
<br>
While simple problems may be solved, more complex and less intuitive ones are created. When the car was invented, it solved travel limitations but opened up a whole new chapter of environmental concerns.
<br>
<br>
In telemedicine, the main concern is the loss of human contact and its consequences. The long term implications are not known yet, though of course it solves many inconveniences.
</p>

<h3>I know someone who sufferes from a a particular disease who would be interested in participating in trials of the new technology. Would he or she be able to do so? How does this person apply?</h3>
<p>
It may well be possible as developers cannot substitute for real-life testing. Contact addresses are readily available on the web in many cases, so if you are serious then it is worth pursuing not only for your own probable benefit but others in the future.
