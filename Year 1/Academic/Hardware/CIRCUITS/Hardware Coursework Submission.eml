This email is in reply to several asking the same question.

The submission date for the coursework is the 9th November (as stated on
the coursework handout) and not the 6th as stated on the web page.

There are two things to be submitted:
1. A wiring list in the format given in the handout. Don't forget to
include your unique number in a comment.
To do this name your file circuit1.txt, and at the linux prompt type:
submit hw1

2. A short report presenting your design, Karnaugh maps etc to be given
in to the sgo.

Good Luck,

Duncan
