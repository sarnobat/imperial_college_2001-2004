We were unconvinced when deciding if the Cauchy simulated system ever really reached equilibrium. On our first run of the system we had a mean buffer size of 0,37 after 400 seconds and this figure was noticeably decreasing towards zero. The only thing that countered this fall was the unpredictable point in time when a new request would be injected. Perhaps this isn’t surprising as the real system’s behaviour would seem analogous.
The calculated confidence interval is biased to the point during the ‘repeating period’ at which the simulation ended. For example, our simulation was stopped with the mean queue length at 0.79, with the value of e being 0.002.  If it had been taken as the queue length reached the lowest value just before a new request entered, the length would fall well outside the stated confidence interval. Conclusion: the theoretical 95% confidence interval doesn’t reflect reality well.
