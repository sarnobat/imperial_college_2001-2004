\section{Requirements For All Versions of YAMS}

YAMS is written in Java. Hence it requires a JRE (Java Runtime Environment) to run.

If you are unsure if you have one, type in console and fingers crossed:

\texttt{\$ java -version}

If you don't get something like \texttt{Command not found}, YAMS should run happily on your machine.

Otherwise, you'll need to download and install a JRE from sun at: http://java.sun.com.




\section{Requirement For GUI Version}

\begin{itemize}
\item Microsoft Windows Users will not need to do any additional configuration
\item Unix/Linux users will need to start a X-Window session in order to use the GUI version.
\end{itemize}
