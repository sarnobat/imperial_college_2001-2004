YAMS is a simulator for the MIPS processor, which runs a RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Chip) architecture.  As a simulator, it's main task is to correctly simulate a given set of assembler instructions and produce any necessary output.  In addition, there are many features that let you see exactly what is happening as each instruction is executed, such as register and memory contents.  YAMS also includes a comprehensive statistics module so you can see just how efficient the assmebly code is.

The YAMS package will work in two formats - in a console that will run from a command line, and in a user friendly graphical version, so you can see clearly what is happening inside the processor as the assmebly program is being executed.
