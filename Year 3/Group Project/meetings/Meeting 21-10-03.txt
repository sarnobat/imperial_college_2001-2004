Location: 217

Present: Adam, James, Ben, Qian, Sridar, Simon, Apgs
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Summary of topics discussed:

- Min spec has to be something that would deserve a B, ie not too minimal

- The minimum spec could be just what is required for the lab, anything else could be extensions.

- Division of work: 3 main areas, spolit up into pairs
	XML -> priority, shouldnt take so long
	Processor -> Interfaces can be completed quickly
	Assembler -> limited because must wait for the AST before we can test it.



Project management:

- In the end its a project and will get a grade.. the min spec and extensions may not affect too much

- Project management tool eclipse can be found in /vol/linux/apps/  

- RCS might be a more appropriate one to use if the eclipse take too long to work out
 


Possible Extensions Discussed:

- Possibility of using javadoc

- The printing part of statistics could be kept seperate from the data



Report Related:

- It is preferred for the report to be in LaTex (www.ctan.org)

- Report 1 about 10 pages

- Schedule (design, implementation and testing) and division of work needs to be in report 	1

- Details of the integration should also be in report 1
