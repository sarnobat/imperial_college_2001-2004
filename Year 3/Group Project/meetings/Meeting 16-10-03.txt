MINUTES - PROJECT MEETING
=============================================
Date: 16/10/03
Time: 1200

Present: Sridar, Adam, James, Ben, Qian
----------------------------------------------------------

Program features / technical issues:

- Version 1 of the simulator should just give a plain text output of the test
- Version 2 should have a GUI, make use of artwork etc.

- One of the aims of the simulator should be to give overall statistics for a range of input files.  So the ability to read in a list of files, test them all then report average statistics would be needed.

- The compiler lab only uses a few MIPS instructions, but it was suggested that accommodating more instructions could give a higher mark.

- Extra features could include debugging, help windows, graphical representation of the CPU

- It was suggested that the program could be made extensible to allow the handling of new instructions in the database.  Possibly in XML

- All present agreed that Java would be the best to use for the project.

Project Issues:

- Early integration of the project was suggested to get a skeleton model working, then this can be extended afterwards.

- All to look at the existing xspim simulator before Friday to become familiar with it and have an idea of features for our program.

- Next meeting: 0900 Friday 17th October, Blueshift Lab
