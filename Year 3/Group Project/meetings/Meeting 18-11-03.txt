MINUTES - PROJECT MEETING
=============================================
Date: 18/11/03
Time: 1400
Location: Blueshift lab

Present: Adam, James, Ben, Sridhar, Simon, Qian
----------------------------------------------------------

Work should be started on the GUI this week

Sridhar has come up with a proposal
Column1	- File selector
	- Statistics
Column2	- Register content window
	- Data segment - memory contents..
	- Console window (for errors and stdout)
Column3	- Executing control
	- Program code

The issue of breakpointing
	- Have another table (java data struct) that has a list of breakpoints (memory addresses)
	- Better than having a seperate instruction

Errors in the parser and assembler - how show in gui?
	- The gui control will catch the errors and display them somehow
	- It will have the references to the other obects so can get attributes from those

Getting stats back from the list of files
	- Stat manager could create a log file of the stats, so people can print these out

Creating own methods for notifying the GUI methods
	- The subscribe/notify thing could be a waste of time as we know all the classes that are involved

When running through it (not stepping) the notification is not needed in the GUI as you wont be able to see it!
However it should be updated at the end of the programme so you can see the register contents etc

The help file..
	- HTML pages for help is easily possible
	- User documentation - BEN -> learn all about XSLT.. output HTML pages for help

Showing how the registers change
	- Highlight registers. Need to know the dest and source though..

Need to check if any of the compiler labs used input

Sridhar on GUI
Qian on XSLT
Simon on system call
Ben on stat manager/help file
James on assembler/XML
ADAM on assembler
