MINUTES - PROJECT MEETING
=============================================
Date: 24/10/03
Time: 1500
Location: Blueshift Lab

Present: Adam, James, Ben, Qian, Sridhar, Simon
----------------------------------------------------

- Skip, advance, stop, jump - cycle manager
	Should this be done directly by the GUI or the processor?
	Ben and simon to look into this more later (as they are the developers for this section)

- XML spec
	- opcode
	- description
	- operand
The actual schema can be generate from XMLspy
The code for each instruction would need to generate java classes 
How to update the XML would need to be documented so other people can add to it

- Theres only one system call file which is 'syscall'

- Handling exceptions
	Need to be handled in one place ideally, as the GUI will display all errors in one place.
	These will just be caught by the outer most class that executes the programe
	Dont handle exceptions anywhere else (unless they can be fixed directly)

- Monday
	Should have a prototype parser that can handle a few instructions (Sridhar and Jo)
	Processor internals (Ben and Simon)
	Version 1 controller (Adam and James)
