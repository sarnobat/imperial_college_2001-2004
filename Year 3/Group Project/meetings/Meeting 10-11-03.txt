MINUTES - PROJECT MEETING

Date: 10/11/03
Time: 1000
Location: Blueshift Lab

Present: Adam, James, Ben, Qian, Sridhar, Simon
----------------------------------------------------

Progress made so far:

- The parser is now working with a few instructions, but not integrated with the XML yet.  Returns a tree

- Ben hopes to finish his part of the processor bit by middle of this week

- XML can be done in parallel with the GUI as long as the parser is working with a few instructions

- Directives are best treated as instructions, but have to be treated differently in the assembler

- SPIM only supports a subset of these directives, so we should aim for this.

- Adam will come up with a draft for the report which is due in this friday.. each of us can then add to our individual parts, including diagrams..
