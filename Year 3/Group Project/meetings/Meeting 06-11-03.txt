Location: Blueshift Lab

Present: Adam, James, Ben, Qian, Sridhar, Simon
----------------------------------------------------

Progress made so far:

- Adam and James
	- Almost about to write some code..
	- Have an instruction and subclass for each one
	- Main instruction class will be split into 3 sub classes
	- Instruction classes will have links to the operand classes

	- We should read through appendix of the architecture book (adam will put on proj space)
	
Ben and Simon
	- ALU will be a static class
	- Instruction handler will need the code from the XML to bolt on
	- Regsiter manager and memory manager almost done
	- Statistics manager could keep track of how often instructions are being used, as well as how often each line is executed
	- Stat manager will need to read in the instructions from XML 

Sridar and Jo
	- Jo has written a lexer from scratch and a parser
	- A Tree generator needs to be made to make the class structure for each instructions

Main program
	- Main yams.java which is the executable taking the args
	- /parser, /assembler, /processor, /GUI
	- Exception classes should go in the package yams.exceptions
	- JavaDoc should be used
	- Processor will make the memory manager

Report
	- Some early integration should have been attempted
	- Log books have been kept
	- Class diagrams and interfaces
