YAMS INSTALLATION OVERVIEW

Quick Start
-----------

A default build with instructions from DoC 2nd year compiler lab supported
can be found in the 'build' directory.

There are two versions, a console version, and a GUI version.

- To run the console version:

	$ java -jar YAMS.jar -console -if PATH/TO/YOUR/ASM/FILE

	Alternatively, if you have a list of files to run:

	$ java -jar YAMS.jar -console PATH/TO/YOUR/LIST/FILE
	The list file should contain the path of the actual .asm files
	one at a line.

- To run the GUI version:

	$ java -jar YAMS.jar -gui -if PATH/TO/YOUR/ASM/FILE
	
	or
	
	$ java -jar YAMS.jar -gui PATH/TO/YOUR/LIST/FILE



Building A Customized YAMS
--------------------------

A customized build will require Apache Ant, which can be found at:
http://ant.apache.org.

To test your machine, type the following command in console:

	$ ant -version
	
if you see some output like:

	Apache Ant version 1.5.3 compiled on April 16 2003

you are good to go.


Here's how to do the build:
- Edit the configuration XML file. It can be found in the 'conf' directory.
  You should be able to edit that file comfortably with any text editor.

- Go back to the root directory of the YAMS distribution (where the build.xml)
  locates.

- Build a new YAMS.jar usint the following command:
	$ ant

- The fresh new build will be in the 'build' directory. The old build will be
  replaced. So it's good idea to backup the old build.

- Run the build normally as mentioned in Quick Start.
