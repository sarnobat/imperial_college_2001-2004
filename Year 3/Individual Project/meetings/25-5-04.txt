Questions


Do the 'user alterations' have to be semantic ones or can they be simple things like naming?
	Anything useful: Naming, mixed content, subset data all acceptable
Ideas for mapping flexibility: representing mixed content or not; renaming tables, relations; selecting keys; importing only parts of the data.
	See above.
Can SQL deal with cyclic dependencies between tables?
	Alter table allows you to add references afterwards.
Do you know any SQL code formatter apis for java?
	No.
Can you get many-to-many relationships in XML? How would you do it for example with the supplier-part?
	Yes. See the paper about the branches and customers
Any specific instructions on how to write report (please no)?
	Just make sure you include algorithms and data structures
What tense do I use?
	Didn't say. 'We' is okay (but not very common). Don't use 'I'.
How much implementation detail is necessary?
	Just make sure you include algorithms and data structures
	UML diagrams useful but not essential. If you wish to give outsourcing level detail, do it in the appendix.
Won't it be much harder to have a bidirectional mapping if the schema conversion must be flexible?
	Remember you do have the original XML schema to help.

When using examples to demonstrate your theory, declare a few examples you are going to use at the beginning.

Advice from Susan Eisenbach: say whether the technique scales.

Make sure you state which XML constructs you are considering representing (it doesn't have to be all of them, but things like 'extends' aren't immediately representable in the XER model)
