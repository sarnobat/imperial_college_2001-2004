Questions
---------

Enumerated types in PostgreSQL don't exist according to their manual. ?
	No they do not.
	Just use 'CHECK'

For unions, do I have to use a foreign table? That's a bit of a pain.
	Yes.
	Need an intermediate table for simple types like these (the same way you need a choice for a complex type)
	PJM suggested using a generalization hierarchy but this would mean making sure that different subsets didn't use duplicate keys.
	
If I get all the theory accurate but don't implement everything will I still get credit?
	Yes.
	You should make it appear as though you have set up your exhaustive transformations.
	Then implement a subset of it.

Can I use views to integrate tables for simple types?
	No.
	You can't update these, and it's costly to implement all the joins.
	You need to optimize the ER model (and add the information to the meta-tables so that importing data will be easier)

DBLP uses dtds, and so do most of the others. How can I use these datasets?
	http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~pjm/databases/dblibrary.html
	Here the XML schemas generated by the xml files have been uploaded.
	In addition there is an application that pjm has written which could be integrated into the application (dblibrary.jar)
